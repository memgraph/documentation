# Memgraph Lab features

Memgraph Lab provides a powerful and intuitive interface for working with graph
data, offering a range of features to streamline data import, visualization,
query execution and collaboration. Whether you're managing real-time data
streams, customizing graph layouts or sharing queries with your team, Memgraph
Lab enhances your workflow with an extensive set of tools.

## Available features

Memgraph Lab offers a range of features available under both the **Community**
and **Enterprise** licenses. The table below lists all Memgraph Lab features and their availability across
different environments:
- **Desktop**: Installed from the [Memgraph Download
  Hub](https://memgraph.com/download#individual). This version is not
  configurable and does not support all Lab features.
- **Docker (Lab Community)**: Run using the Memgraph Lab Docker image from
  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/memgraph/lab). It is configurable, but
  to access Enterprise features, you must set Memgraph Enterprise license
  environment variables.
- **Docker (Lab Enterprise)**: Same Docker image as above, but launched with the
  required [Memgraph Enterprise license environment
  variables](/memgraph-lab/configuration#adding-memgraph-enterprise-license).
  Fully configurable and supports all Memgraph Lab features, including
  Enterprise-only features.
