# Memgraph Lab features 

Memgraph Lab provides a powerful and intuitive interface for working with graph
data, offering a range of features to streamline data import, visualization,
query execution, and collaboration. Whether you're managing real-time data
streams, customizing graph layouts, or sharing queries with your team, Memgraph
Lab enhances your workflow with an extensive set of tools.

## Available features

Memgraph Lab offers a range of features available under both the **Community**
and **Enterprise** licenses. Some features require that Memgraph is [configured
with an Enterprise license](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise),
while others depend on Memgraph Lab being deployed with the correct [environment
variables](/memgraph-lab/fundamentals/remote-storage#how-to-set-it-up) and a
valid Enterprise license.

Availability can also vary depending on the deployment type — Desktop and
Docker deployments may support different subsets of features, even within
the Community version.

For details on how to enable and configure each feature, refer to their
individual documentation pages listed in the table below.
