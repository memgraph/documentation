# Memgraph Lab features 

Memgraph Lab provides a powerful and intuitive interface for working with graph
data, offering a range of features to streamline data import, visualization,
query execution and collaboration. Whether you're managing real-time data
streams, customizing graph layouts or sharing queries with your team, Memgraph
Lab enhances your workflow with an extensive set of tools.

## Available features

Memgraph Lab offers a range of features available under both the **Community**
and **Enterprise** licenses. Some features require that Memgraph is configured
with an Enterprise license, while others depend on Memgraph Lab being deployed
with the valid Enterprise license.

The table below lists all Memgraph Lab features and their availability across
different environments:
- **Desktop**: Installed from the [Memgraph Download
  Hub](https://memgraph.com/download#individual). This version is not
  configurable and does not support all Lab features.
- **Docker (Lab Community)**: Run using the Memgraph Lab Docker image from
  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/memgraph/lab). It is configurable, but
  to access Enterprise features, you must set Memgraph Enterprise license
  environment variables.
- **Docker (Lab Enterprise)**: Same Docker image as above, but launched with the
  required [Memgraph Enterprise license environment
  variables](/memgraph-lab/configuration#adding-memgraph-enterprise-license).
  Fully configurable and supports all Memgraph Lab features, including
  Enterprise-only features.
