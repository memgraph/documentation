# Streams management

In Memgraph Lab, you can connect to a data stream by running a series of Cypher
queries or you can connect to it using the **Streams** section.

Once you enter basic information about the stream, such as type, name, server
address and topics, the Streams section allows you to add an existing query
module containing transformation procedure or to write a new one in Python.

When saving a new query module, Memgraph Lab will automatically detect
transformation procedures within it, which you can then attach to the created
stream.

Adding Kafka Configuration Parameters is also done via the Stream section, as
well as managing the connection - starting, pausing or deleting it.
