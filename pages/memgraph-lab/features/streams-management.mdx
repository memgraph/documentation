# Streams management

Memgraph can connect to existing Kafka, Redpanda, and Pulsar data streams,
enabling you to ingest data directly. Memgraph Lab offers an intuitive interface
for managing streams under the **Streams** section. You can also manage streams
manually through Cypher queries for greater control. For more details, check the
[stream reference guide](/data-streams/manage-streams-query).


This guide provides detailed instructions on how to:

- [Add a new stream](#add-a-new-stream): Learn how to connect Memgraph to a new Kafka,
  Redpanda, or Pulsar stream by configuring the stream name, server address, and
  subscribing to the relevant topics.

- [Edit stream settings](#edit-stream-settings): Discover how to modify key settings such as the
  consumer group, batch interval, and batch size to fine-tune the data stream
  for your specific use case.

- [Add a transformation module](#add-a-transformation-module): Understand the process of attaching a
  transformation module, either in Python or C/C++, to process and convert data
  from the stream into Cypher queries that update the graph in Memgraph.

- [Set Kafka configuration parameters](#set-kafka-configuration-parameters): Customize your Kafka stream connection by
  adding necessary configuration parameters to ensure secure and efficient data
  transfer.

- [Start a stream](#start-a-stream): Once your stream and transformation module are ready,
  follow the steps to start the stream, enabling data ingestion into Memgraph in
  real-time.

- [Manage a stream](#manage-a-stream): Learn how to start, stop, and delete streams, as well as
  manage the transformation module and adjust the stream offset during the
  stream’s lifecycle. 

- [Configure Kafka stream offset](#configure-kafka-stream-offset): Gain insight into how to adjust Kafka stream
  offsets via Cypher queries, allowing for precise control over data
  consumption.

## Add a new stream

In Memgraph Lab, you can easily connect to a new data stream. To do this:

1. Navigate to the **Streams** section and click **Add new stream**.
2. Choose between Kafka/Redpanda or Pulsar.
3. Provide the stream name, the server address where data is being streamed
   from, and the topics you're subscribing to.

## Edit stream settings

To modify a stream’s configuration, click on the Edit (pencil icon). From there,
you can adjust settings such as:
- Consumer group
- Batch interval
- Batch size

This gives you control over how your data is consumed and processed.

## Add a transformation module

To connect to a stream, you first need to attach a [transformation
module](/data-streams/transformation-modules#creating-a-transformation-module)
to it. 

![](/pages/data-visualization/features/streams-management/add-transformation-module.png)

The transformation module is a query module containing a user-defined
procedure, written either in Python or C/C++, that processes incoming data into
Cypher queries for updating Memgraph’s graph.

To add a Python transformation module to a stream:
1. Click on **Add transformation module**.
2. Expand on **Choose transformation module**.
3. Select an existing transformation module or **+ Create new transformation**.
4. Review an existing module or clear the screen and name and write a new transformation
   procedure.
5. Save the transformation module.
6. Check if the necessary transformation procedure is visible under **Detected
   transformation functions** on the right.
7. Select a transformation procedure and click on **Attach to stream**.

For Python modules, you can write and test the transformation procedure directly
within Memgraph Lab. Alternatively, if you’ve already developed a C/C++
procedure, it needs to be [loaded into
Memgraph](/data-streams/manage-streams-query#how-to-create-and-load-a-transformation-module-into-memgraph)
first before attaching it to the stream.

Once attached, you can proceed with [starting the stream](#start-the-stream).

## Set Kafka configuration parameters

If necessary, add the Kafka configuration parameters to customize the stream further:

1. In the Kafka configuration parameters click on  **+ Add parameter field**.
2. Insert the parameter name and value.
3. To add another parameter, click on **+ Add parameter field**.
4. Click on **Save configuration** once you have set all parameters.

For example, to connect to the [Awesome Data
Stream](https://awesomedata.stream/), use the following configuration:
* **sasl.username** \| public <br/>
* **sasl.password** \| public <br/>
* **security.protocol** \| SASL_PLAINTEXT <br/>
* **sasl.mechanism** \| PLAIN <br/>

These parameters will enable Memgraph to securely connect to the Kafka server.

## Start a stream

Once the stream is configured, you can click on **Connect to stream**. 

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/streams.png)

Memgraph will do a series of checks, ensuring that defined topics and
transformation procedures are correctly configured. If all checks pass
successfully, you can click on **Start the stream**. Once you start the stream,
you will no longer be able to change any of the configuration settings, just the
transformation module. 

The stream status changes to **Running**, and data is ingested into Memgraph.
You can see the number of nodes and relationships rising as the data keeps
coming in. If your nodes and relationships numbers stay at zero, check the
transformation module, as there might be a flaw in the logic that needs to be
resolved. 

Switch to **Query execution** and monitor the data ingestion by running a query
like: 

```
MATCH p=(n)-[r]-(m)
RETURN p LIMIT 100;
```

This will show the graph being populated in real-time. If the node and
relationship counts remain zero, it might indicate an issue with the
transformation procedure.

## Manage a stream

To start a draft stream, click on **Connect to stream**.

To manage an existing stream:
1. Navigate to the **Streams** section.
2. Click the stream you wish to manage.

From here, you can:
- **Start** or **Stop** the stream.
- **Delete** the stream (note that this action is irreversible).

If you need to adjust the transformation module or the stream offset, you can do
so at any time, but keep in mind that you cannot modify a stream once it is
running.

## Configure Kafka stream offset

To change the Kafka stream offset, use the following query:

```cypher
CALL mg.kafka_set_stream_offset(streamName, offset)
```

- Setting the offset to `-1` will reset to the beginning of the topic.
- Setting it to `-2` will start from the end of the stream, consuming only new messages.
