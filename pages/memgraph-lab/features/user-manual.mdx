# Memgraph Lab user manual

[**TODO**] INCORPORATE TO OTHER PAGES


## Overview

<Callout>

If you're having trouble using `Ctrl + V` for copy-paste actions in Memgraph Lab
over HTTP, it's likely related to security protocols implemented by your web
browser. To avoid this you can allow clipboard access for specific
unsecured domains, but be
cautious as this lowers browser security.

Here's how you can do it in Chrome:
1. Go to `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`.
2. Enter the unsecured domain URL in "Insecure origins treated as secure".
3. Enable the setting and restart Chrome.

Use this method only for trusted sites due to the security implications.

The data associated with your setting, including saved queries, run history,
collection configurations, and styles, is stored directly in your browser's
storage (local storage and IndexedDB) or within the Memgraph Lab desktop app's
storage. This storage approach links your Query Collections and other objects to
your current browser profile or the specific installation of the Memgraph Lab
desktop app.

- **Browser dependency:** Your access to collections, styles, or query history
  is tied to the browser you use. Switching browsers means you won't see your
  previously saved collections or styles.
- **Private browsing:** Using private browsing mode will not display your
  existing collections, styles, or query history, and any collections or styles
  saved during such a session will be lost once the session ends.
- **User Profiles:** Different user profiles or logins within the same browser
  will each have their own set of Query Collections, styles, and query history,
  separate from one another.

To ensure you can always access your collections and styles, it's important to
use the same browser and user profile.

## Graph schema

If you need to check the data model of the data currently in the database, you
can generate a graph schema that will show all the node types and relationships
between them.

By selecting a certain node or relationship type, Lab will provide information
about the current number of nodes or relationships of that type, as well as
percentage of existence of each property across the nodes and relationships of
that type.

## Logs

To be able to see logs from Memgraph Lab application you need to open port 7444
when starting Memgraph with Docker.

Check [how to access logs and modify logging](/database-management/logs).

You can set the number of visible logs in the **Settings** section.
