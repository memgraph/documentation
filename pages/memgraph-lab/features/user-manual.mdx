# Memgraph Lab user manual

[**TODO**] INCORPORATE TO OTHER PAGES

**Memgraph Lab** is a **visual user interface** that enables you to import and
export data to and from Memgraph database, write and execute Cypher queries,
visualize graph data, view and optimize query performance, develop query modules
in Python or connect to data streams.

Here is a short overview of the Lab's interface, features it provides, and links
to resources that will help you achieve your graph goals. At the end of the
page, there is a Lab demo video from the Memgraph Cloud launch if you need more
visual input.

## Overview

<Callout>

If you're having trouble using `Ctrl + V` for copy-paste actions in Memgraph Lab
over HTTP, it's likely related to security protocols implemented by your web
browser. To avoid this you can allow clipboard access for specific
unsecured domains, but be
cautious as this lowers browser security.

Here's how you can do it in Chrome:
1. Go to `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`.
2. Enter the unsecured domain URL in "Insecure origins treated as secure".
3. Enable the setting and restart Chrome.

Use this method only for trusted sites due to the security implications.

</Callout>

Starting from Lab 2.16, various connection types are available in addition
to the default Bolt connection to a standalone Memgraph instance. For more
information, see [Connection Types](/data-visualization/user-manual/connection-types).

Every time you open Memgraph Lab, it will greet you with an **Overview**,
offering resources and actions depending whether your database is empty or not,
and whether you ran any queries or not.

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/overview.png)

At the top of the screen, you will find information about:
- Connection status
- Memgraph version, IP address, and port of the database
- Set up [multi-tenancy](/database-management/multi-tenancy)
- [Storage mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#storage-modes)
- Number of nodes and relationships currently in the database
- Disk storage used, and total and available RAM

In the top right corner, you can find the help and notification buttons. The
help section provides you with helpful documentation and links to the Memgraph
community, while the notification section is used to inform you about important
events within the Memgraph ecosystem.

All the Memgraph Lab sections are listed in the left side menu, below which you
can find the [Layout](#layout) options and Memgraph Lab version along with the
release notes and notifications about new software versions.

<Callout>

The data associated with your setting, including saved queries, run history,
collection configurations, and styles, is stored directly in your browser's
storage (local storage and IndexedDB) or within the Memgraph Lab desktop app's
storage. This storage approach links your Query Collections and other objects to
your current browser profile or the specific installation of the Memgraph Lab
desktop app.

- **Browser dependency:** Your access to collections, styles, or query history
  is tied to the browser you use. Switching browsers means you won't see your
  previously saved collections or styles.
- **Private browsing:** Using private browsing mode will not display your
  existing collections, styles, or query history, and any collections or styles
  saved during such a session will be lost once the session ends.
- **User Profiles:** Different user profiles or logins within the same browser
  will each have their own set of Query Collections, styles, and query history,
  separate from one another.

To ensure you can always access your collections and styles, it's important to
use the same browser and user profile.

</Callout>


## Query execution

In this section, you can write and run queries, as well as see their tabular or
graphical results.




## GraphChat

[GraphChat](/data-visualization/user-manual/graphchat) is a feature within Memgraph Lab that
allows users to query the Memgraph database using the English language instead
of Cypher queries.

## Query sharing

[Query sharing](/data-visualization/user-manual/query-sharing) is an Enterprise feature
introduced in Lab 2.15, allowing users to create a shareable link for their
Cypher query, Graph Style Script, and query parameters with a single click. This
enables seamless collaboration among team members.

## Single sign-on (SSO)

[Single sign-on (SSO)](/data-visualization/user-manual/single-sign-on) is a Memgraph
Enterprise feature that provides authorization and authentification to your database.

## Run history

Here you can search or view ran queries or applied styles, with the information
about the time of the last run, runtime and whether the execution was successful
or not.

If the last action within the Query Execution was a query run, a clock icon will
appear next to the query. If the last action was the application of a style, a
clock icon will appear next to the style name. If the action included both the
execution of a query and the application of the style, the clock icon will
appear next to both.

If the Query Editor includes several queries, but only one query was selected
and ran, the Query column of the Run History will show only that query, but the
full contents of the Query Editor will be previewed by expanding the row.
Expanding the Style Name column will show the Graph Style Script (GSS) code of
the style.

In the Run History you can run rerun queries in the current or new execution
view, copy them into clipboard, and save them to an existing or new collection.

You can filter the data to view just the query history, the style history or
both.

You can clear the run history in the **Settings** section.

## Query modules

[Query modules](/advanced-algorithms) are
collections of procedures written in **C**, **C++**, **Python**, and **Rust**
(either `*.so` or `*.py` files) to extend the query language. Transformation
procedures necessary to ingest data from data streams are also written as query
modules.

Some query modules are built-in, and others, like those that can help you solve
complex graph issues, are available as part of the [MAGE](/advanced-algorithms)
library you can add to your Memgraph installation. The library is already
included if you are using [Memgraph
Platform](/getting-started/install-memgraph) or [Memgraph
MAGE](/advanced-algorithms/install-mage) Docker images to run Memgraph, or you are
connecting to a [Cloud](/getting-started/install-memgraph/memgraph-cloud) instance.

All the query modules and procedures are listed in the **Query Modules**
section. By expanding the information about each query module, you can see the
procedures it contains, as well as their signatures and examples.

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/query-modules.png)

In this section, you can also implement your own custom query modules written in
Python by clicking on the **+ New Module**. A new file will open with example
procedures you can examine and learn from. Once you have written and saved the
query module, Memgraph Lab will automatically detect procedures within it, which
you can then call from queries.

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/custom-query-modules.png)

If you need help writing custom query modules, check out the [reference
guide](/custom-query-modules/python/python-example),
or a [tutorial](/custom-query-modules/python/implement-custom-query-module-in-python)
on query modules.

## Streams

In Memgraph Lab, you can connect to a data stream by running a series of Cypher
queries or you can connect to it using the **Streams** section.

Once you enter basic information about the stream, such as type, name, server
address and topics, the Streams section allows you to add an existing query
module containing transformation procedure or to write a new one in Python.

When saving a new query module, Memgraph Lab will automatically detect
transformation procedures within it, which you can then attach to the created
stream.

Adding Kafka Configuration Parameters is also done via the Stream section, as
well as managing the connection - starting, pausing or deleting it.

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/streams.png)

Check out the [reference guide on streams](/data-streams), and check [a how-to
guide on connecting to data streams](/data-streams/manage-streams-lab) from
Memgraph Lab.

## Graph schema

If you need to check the data model of the data currently in the database, you
can generate a graph schema that will show all the node types and relationships
between them.

By selecting a certain node or relationship type, Lab will provide information
about the current number of nodes or relationships of that type, as well as
percentage of existence of each property across the nodes and relationships of
that type.

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/schema.png)

## Datasets

From the Datasets section, you can load interesting datasets varying in topics
and size. You can use the datasets to explore the Cypher query language and
Memgraph Lab features, or to experiment with data before you tackle your own
more complex issues.

You can check the structure of the dataset by checking its graph schema, as well
as reading the explanations of all the entities and their properties.

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/dataset.png)

There are several
[tutorials](/querying/exploring-datasets) you can use to
explore the datasets available in Memgraph Lab.

## Import

You can import data using a [CSV file import tool](/data-visualization/user-manual/csv-file-import), by
connecting to a [Kafka or Pulsar stream](/data-streams) or using a
[CYPHERL format](/data-migration/cypherl), which represents data in the form of
Cypher queries.

<Callout>

When importing `.cypherl` files via Memgraph Lab, please be aware that all
existing indexes are automatically dropped during the import process. This means
that any indexes intended to speed up the import will not be effective unless
they are explicitly defined within the `.cypherl` file itself. To ensure optimal
performance during data import, include [`CREATE INDEX`](/fundamentals/indexes)
queries at the beginning of your `.cypherl` file.

</Callout>

To import data from other sources, check the [guides on importing](/data-migration).

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/import.png)

## Export

In this section, you can export data using a [CYPHERL format](/data-migration/cypherl).

To import data from other sources, check the [guides on exporting](/data-migration/export-data).

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/export.png)

## Logs

To be able to see logs from Memgraph Lab application you need to open port 7444
when starting Memgraph with Docker.

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/logs.png)

Check [how to access logs and modify logging](/database-management/logs).

You can set the number of visible logs in the **Settings** section.

## Settings

In the Settings section you can check your unique application identification
number and the Lab version.

You can also adjust the limits after which Lab will no longer give code
completion suggestions, or automatically render graph results.

In the settings you can also clear the run history and set the number of saved
records, as well as the number of log records.

In the Graph Style Library you can rename or delete styles, set them as the
default style or see their code.

Here, you can also adjust the LLM settings.

## Layout

You can split the work area horizontally to work with 2 sections at the same
time, or vertically to work with up to 5 sections simultaneously.

You can also combine the horizontal and vertical split.

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/layouts.png)

## Versions

Memgraph Lab will notify you when a new version is available. By clicking on the
version you can see what changes it brought compared to the previous version.
