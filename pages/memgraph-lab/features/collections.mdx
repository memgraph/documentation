## Create a new collection

To create a new collection by heading over to the **Collections**. From there,
click on **Create collection**.

![create-collection](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/create-collection.png)

First, you can add previously executed queries to the new collection or create
an empty collection.

![add-query](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/add-query.png)

Then, you need to define the collection name.

![collection-name](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/collection-name.png)

After the collection has been created, you will see all queries added to that
collection.

![collection-queries](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/collection-queries.png)

There, you can directly run, share or edit your queries.

![edit-query](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/edit-query.png)

To create a new query in the collection, click on **Add query**. 

Queries can also be added to the collection from the **Query Execution** after
running the query.

Another way of adding queries to the collection is from the **Run history**
section.

You need to define **Query name** and add it to one of the existing collections
or create a new one.

Query collections can also be imported and exported to JSON file format. This
eases the process of collection sharing with your team.

## Pre-prepared collections 

After loading a dataset from the Dataset section, you can download the query
collection containing the queries that will help you get familiar with the
certain dataset. 

![download-query-collection](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/download-query-collection.png)

For example, if you loaded the Game of Thrones dataset and downloaded the query
collection, you will get the following queries:
