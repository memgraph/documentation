# Collections

​In Memgraph Lab, the collections feature allows you to organize and manage your
Cypher queries efficiently by grouping them into named collections. This
functionality is particularly useful for structuring queries related to specific
projects, datasets, or analytical tasks, enhancing both organization and
collaboration.​

With the collections feature, you can: 

- **Organized query management**: Group related queries together to streamline your
workflow and quickly locate specific queries when needed.​

- **Enhanced collaboration**: Share collections with team members, facilitating better
collaboration and ensuring consistency across projects.​ 

- **Efficient query execution**: Execute queries directly from their respective
collections, reducing redundancy and improving productivity.​

## Create a collection 

To begin organizing your queries, you'll first need to create a new collection.

To create a new collection, navigate to the **Collections** in Memgraph Lab and
click on **Create collection**. 

![create-collection](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/create-collection.png)

Next, you will be prompted to directly **add previously executed queries** to
the collection. You can skip this step and add your queries later. 

![add-query](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/add-query.png)

To finish creating the collection, enter a meaningful **collection name** that
reflects the purpose or context of the queries it will contain.

## Add queries to a collection

There are three main ways to add queries to a collection in Memgraph Lab,
depending on where you are in the interface:

- [From the Query execution](#add-query-from-the-query-execution)
- [From the Run history](#add-query-from-the-run-history)
- [From the Collections](#add-query-from-the-collections)

Every query is defined with its name (required) and description (optional).

### Add query from the Query execution

After executing a query, you can save it directly to a collection.

![add-to-collection](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/add-to-collection.png)

You can either choose an **existing collection** from the dropdown or **create a new
one** on the spot by entering a name during the flow.
You'll also need to provide a **query name** before saving.

### Add query from the Run history

You can revisit previously executed queries and add them to a collection.

![add-from-run-history](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/add-from-run-history.png)

You can either choose an **existing collection** from the dropdown or **create a
new one** on the spot by entering a name during the flow.

### Add query from the Collections

If you're managing collections directly, simply select a collection and click
**Add query** to manually write and add a new query to the currently open
collection.

## Importing and exporting collections

Query collections can be exported and imported as JSON files, making it easy to
share across teams or back up your work.

## Pre-prepared collections 

Memgraph Lab includes a set of pre-prepared query collections available upon
loading a pre-prepared dataset. These collections serve as curated, ready-to-use
examples designed to help users:

- Explore Memgraph features quickly
- Learn how to write effective Cypher queries
- Understand use cases across domains like fraud detection, recommendation
systems, or network analysis

Each pre-prepared collection in Memgraph Lab contains a set of named and
categorized Cypher queries, designed to help users explore specific topics or
use cases. These queries come with comments and descriptions that explain their
purpose and functionality, making them easy to understand and modify. The
collections are built around sample datasets — such as social networks or
knowledge graphs — so users can immediately see how queries operate on realistic
graph structures.

Pre-prepared collections are especially valuable for beginners or users new to
graph databases, as they offer a hands-on way to learn by example. They also
significantly reduce setup time, allowing users to dive straight into graph
analysis without starting from scratch. Beyond learning, these collections help
illustrate real-world applications of Memgraph, making it easier to discover and
explore different use cases.

### Download a collection 

After loading a dataset from the Dataset section, you can download the query
collection containing the queries related to that dataset. 

![download-query-collection](/pages/data-visualization/features/collections/download-query-collection.png)

For example, if you loaded the Game of Thrones dataset and downloaded the query
collection, you will get the following queries:
