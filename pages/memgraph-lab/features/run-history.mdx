# Run history

The **Run history** feature in Memgraph Lab helps you track previously executed
Cypher queries and applied styles in one place. It provides a searchable,
filterable log of past actions, including execution time, status, and the
ability to rerun or reuse queries. You can view the full history, focus on
either queries or styles, and manage stored records directly from the Settings
section.

<Callout type="info">
Run history is stored locally in the browser, so any new browser instance will
have a fresh state.
</Callout>

## Explore run history

Run history shows entries that include these columns:
- **Query**: The Cypher query that was executed
- **Style**: Any applied Graph Style Script (GSS)
- **Last run**: The date and time of the last run
- **Runtime (ms)**: The runtime in milliseconds
- **Status**: The execution status (successful or failed)
- **Actions**: Each entry includes the following actions:
    - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Rerunning the query in the current view or in a new vertical or horizontal split
    - üìë Copying the query to clipboard
    - ‚ûï Adding the query to an existing or new query collection

<Callout type="info">
A clock icon (üïì) appears next to the last executed element‚Äîeither the query or the
style. If both were executed together, the icon will appear next to both.
</Callout>

You can choose to view:
- **All**: Includes both query and style data
- **Query history**: Only the queries and their related info
- **Style history**: Only applied styles, without queries, runtime, or status

<Callout type="info">
When a Cypher editor contains multiple queries, but only one is selected and run,
the Query column will display just the executed query. Expanding the row will
reveal the full contents of the editor. Similarly, the Style column can be
expanded to show the full GSS code.
</Callout>

To help you quickly find past actions, you can **search and filter** by query
history.

## Manage run history

You can manage your run history in the Settings section, where you can set a
limit on the number of stored records. By default, this limit is set to 1,000
actions. Increasing it beyond this value may impact Memgraph Lab‚Äôs performance.
