# Logs


Memgraph Lab allows you to view logs directly within the application, making it easier to debug queries, monitor system behavior and understand how Memgraph is operating under the hood. To see logs from the Memgraph Lab interface, make sure to open port `7444` when running Memgraph with Docker.

## Enable log access

To ensure logs are visible in Memgraph Lab:

1. If you're running Memgraph via Docker, include the port mapping in your
   Docker command:

```bash
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph
```
2. Port `7444` enables communication between Memgraph and Lab for log streaming.
3. Once this is done, navigate to the **Logs** section in the sidebar and logs
   should start appearing in real time.


## Adjust log display settings

You can control how many logs are visible by default by going to the
**Settings** panel in Memgraph Lab. Options include:
- Setting the maximum number of log entries shown in the interface.
- Filtering log entries by type (e.g., `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`).
- Clearing logs manually to reduce clutter while debugging.

This flexibility ensures you can tailor the logging view based on your workflow
and focus only on what matters.


For more advanced configuration options, visit [logs and modify logging](/database-management/logs) section of the docs.
