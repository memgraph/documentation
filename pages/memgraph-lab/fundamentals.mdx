# Fundamentals

Memgraph Lab offers flexibility and advanced features through its  configuration
system and enterprise-grade remote storage. Whether you're optimizing your
development environment or enabling team collaboration, these tools help you get
the most out of Lab.

## Configuration

Running Memgraph Lab with Docker or Docker Compose gives you full control over
its behavior through environment variables. You can:
- **Set limits** for query size, module content, and node labels
- Enable or disable features like **validation**, **logging**, **SSL** and
  **authentication**
- Customize connection settings for **quick connect** or **enterprise
  integrations**

With over 30 configurable variables, Lab can be tailored for anything from local
development to production-ready setups. 

For a full list of environment variables and usage examples, visit the
[Configuration](/memgraph-lab/fundamentals/configuration) page.

## Remote storage (*Enterprise*)

Remote storage allows Lab to store shared data in a centralized Memgraph instance rather than the browser, making it easier to:
- **Collaborate** across teams
- Access your work from different machines or locations
- **Secure sensitive information** outside the browser context

To enable this feature, you'll need a valid Memgraph Enterprise license and a Docker-based deployment. Lab supports connecting to either a standalone Memgraph instance or a separate database in a multi-tenant environment. Flexible connection settings (SSL, auth, timeout) ensure secure and reliable storage.

For detailed setup instructions and example configurations, see the [Remote storage](/memgraph-lab/fundamentals/remote-storage) page.
