# Querying

Memgraph Lab is a visual interface designed to enable interaction with the
Memgraph database. It's packed with features that make the writing, executing,
and visualizing Cypher queries straightforward. In this section, we’ll dive into
everything you can do when it comes to querying in Memgraph Lab—from how to run
queries to customizing how your graph looks. 

## Capabilities
Memgraph Lab is equipped with advanced capabilities that enhance the querying and visualization process:​

{<h3 className="custom-header">GSS sharing</h3>}

{<h3 className="custom-header">Query modules</h3>}

Memgraph Lab also supports query modules, which are collections of procedures written in C, C++, Python, or Rust that extend the query language. You can view all available query modules in the Query Modules section, and even implement your own custom query modules in Python directly within Memgraph Lab.

## Querying
TODO, REWRITE
Executing queries in Memgraph Lab is designed to be intuitive and flexible, accommodating both novice and experienced users:.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Cypher editor</h3>}

The **Cypher editor** is the primary interface for writing and executing queries in Memgraph Lab. It features a code suggestion tool that can help you with clause completion and give information about signatures and parameters.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Run selected</h3>}

**Run selected** allows you to execute only a highlighted portion of your query.
It is particularly useful for testing and debugging specific segments of complex
queries without running the entire script. By selecting the desired portion and
clicking "Run Selected", you can isolate and evaluate individual components of
your query.​

{/*TODO: add image*/}

{<h3 className="custom-header">Run query</h3>}

The **Run query** button executes the entire query written in the editor. This
is the standard method for running complete Cypher queries and retrieving
results from the database.​

{<h3 className="custom-header">Parameters</h3>}

Memgraph Lab supports the use of **parameters** within queries to enhance efficiency. By defining parameters, you can write queries that accept variable inputs without altering the query structure. For example:​

```cypher
  MATCH (n {property: $value})
  RETURN n;
```

In this query, `$value` is a parameter that can be assigned different values at runtime. Utilizing parameters not only makes your queries more adaptable but also improves performance by enabling query plan caching.

## Query Status bar

{/*TODO: add image*/}

The query status bar in Memgraph Lab provides real-time feedback and essential
information about your queries:​


{<h3 className="custom-header">Execution time</h3>}

Displays the time taken by Memgraph to execute the query, helping you assess
performance.​ For insights into optimizing execution time, see the Querying Best
Practices guide.​
{/*TODO: add link above*/}

{<h3 className="custom-header">Full roundtrip time</h3>}

Indicates the total time from sending the query to receiving and rendering the
results in Memgraph Lab. This metric is crucial for understanding the overall
efficiency of your query execution and result retrieval process. 

{<h3 className="custom-header">Result count</h3>}

Shows the number of rows returned by the query, providing a
quick overview of the result set size.​

{<h3 className="custom-header">Nodes and relationships returned</h3>}

Indicates the number of nodes and
relationships included in the query results, offering insight into the
complexity and scope of the returned data.​

{<h3 className="custom-header">Multiple results</h3>}

When executing multiple queries simultaneously, the status
bar allows you to navigate through each result set, ensuring you can efficiently
manage and analyze multiple outputs.​

{<h3 className="custom-header">Save query</h3>}

Offers options to copy or add queries to existing or new
collection. This feature is particularly useful for building a repository of
frequently used queries or collaborating with team members.​

{<h3 className="custom-header">Breakdown</h3>}

## Query results

Memgraph Lab offers versatile options for viewing and analyzing query results,
catering to different analytical needs.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Data results</h3>}

Presents results in a tabular format, displaying nodes, relationships, and their
properties in a structured manner. This view is ideal for detailed data
inspection and is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets where a
graphical representation may be overwhelming.​

{<h3 className="custom-header">Graph results</h3>}

Renders results as a graph visualization, illustrating the nodes and
relationships returned by the query. This view is beneficial for understanding
the structural and relational aspects of your data. Memgraph Lab utilizes the
Orb library for high-performance graph visualizations, ensuring a smooth and
interactive experience.

## Query summary

After executing a query in Memgraph Lab, the query summary provides essential
metadata and insights into the execution process. This summary helps users
evaluate the performance, efficiency, and impact of their queries.

{/*TODO: add images*/} 

{<h3 className="custom-header">Statistics</h3>}

Displays key database impact metrics such as:
- The number of hops traversed.
- The number of nodes and relationships created, updated or deleted.
- The number of labels, indexes and constraints
- The number of properties modified within the dataset.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Query performance</h3>}

For complex queries, Memgraph Lab provides an execution
plan that breaks down how the query was processed by the database. This can help
users optimize performance by identifying potential bottlenecks.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Warnings & notifications</h3>}

If there are potential issues with the query, such
as missing indexes or inefficient query patterns, Memgraph Lab will provide
notifications and recommendations for optimization. For detailed guidelines on
query optimization, visit the [query performance optimization
guide](https://memgraph.com/docs/querying/performance-optimization).

{<h3 className="custom-header">Query profile</h3>}

{/*TODO: add content*/} 


## Graph results customization

Memgraph Lab provides customization options for visualizing graph results,
allowing users to tailor the display of nodes and relationships according to
their needs.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Graph Style Script</h3>}

**Graph Style Script (GSS)** is a custom scripting language developed by
Memgraph that allows users to define and apply styles to graph visualizations.
With GSS, you can customize various visual aspects of your graph, including node
colors, sizes, shapes, and relationship styles. This level of customization
enables you to create tailored visual representations that align with your
analytical needs. For a comprehensive guide on utilizing GSS, refer to the Graph
Style Script documentation. 
{/*TODO: add link above*/} 
{/*TODO: add image*/} 

{<h3 className="custom-header">Property sidebar</h3>}

The property sidebar provides a detailed view of the selected node or
relationship. Users can manually edit node properties, add new attributes or
remove existing ones. This feature is particularly useful for making quick
modifications to graph data without executing additional queries. 
{/*TODO: add image*/} 

{<h3 className="custom-header">GSS vs. property sidebar</h3>}

- **GSS** is used for styling and customizing how graph elements appear,
  ensuring that visual patterns are easy to interpret.
- **The Property Sidebar** is used for modifying actual data attributes without
  affecting the visual styling.

By leveraging these customization features, users can create meaningful and
interactive graph representations, enhancing their ability to explore and
analyze graph data effectively.
