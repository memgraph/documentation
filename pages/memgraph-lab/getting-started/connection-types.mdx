# Connection types

Starting from Lab 2.16, Memgraph Lab supports three types of
connections to your Memgraph instances:

1. Connect to a standalone instance
2. Connect to a [main or replica instance](/clustering/replication)
3. Connect to a [HA cluster with automatic failover](/clustering/high-availability)

## Connect to a standalone instance

This is the regular Bolt connection to a single Memgraph
instance. You will need to define:

- **Host**: Either `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`,
  or another appropriate address.
- **Port**: Enter `7687`, which Memgraph uses by default.
- **Logs Port**: Default is `7444`, the port for web socket
  logs.
- **Database Name**: Leave empty unless connecting to a
  [multi-tenant Memgraph instance](/database-management/multi-tenancy).
- **Encrypted**: Choose whether the connection is
  encrypted (`SSL on` or `SSL off`).

### Connection color

You can choose a color for your connection. This color will be
displayed below the status bar and titles to help distinguish
between different environments when connecting to multiple
Memgraph instances from the same Lab instance.

### Coordinator instance

Standalone connections can also be used to connect to a
[Coordinator instance](/clustering/high-availability). When
connecting to the Coordinator, the Lab UI changes to support only
cluster management queries. You will see components like query
execution, run history, query collections, and query sharing.
The status bar will display the number of active and total
coordinators and data instances instead of the number of nodes,
relationships, and memory/disk metrics.

## Connect to a main or replica instance

Connecting to a [main or replica instance](/clustering/replication)
is similar to connecting to a standalone instance with an additional
status bar difference upon successful connection: Replication status
overview.

### Replication status

If connected to a main instance, the status bar will display
replication status, including the status of replicas and their
system and data replication status. The status bar will also
show that you are connected to the "Main" instance.

If connected to a replica, you will not see the replication status
because replicas do not have the permission to display this
information. The status bar will show that you are connected to
the "Replica" instance.

## Connect to an HA cluster with automatic failover

The [HA cluster](/clustering/high-availability) is an enterprise
feature that supports automatic failover with a set of coordinators
and data instances. Choose the "HA Cluster" connection type and
input the **Host** and **Port** of any coordinator instance.

Once you are in, you can run queries and manage data similar to
a standalone or main/replica instance connection.

### Cluster status

![](/pages/data-visualization/lab-user-manual/connection-types/conn-type-ha-cluster-status.png)

When connected to the HA cluster, the status bar provides
additional information about the cluster status, showing
the status of each coordinator and data instance.
