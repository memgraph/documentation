## Install Memgraph Lab desktop application

<Steps>

{<h3 className="custom-header">Ensure Memgraph is running</h3>}

Memgraph Lab requires a [running Memgraph database instance](/getting-started).

If you installed Memgraph using Docker, ensure that ports `7687`, used for
instance connections (`-p 7687:7687`), and `7444`, used for logs (`-p
7444:7444`), are exposed.

<Callout type="info"> Connecting Memgraph Lab to Memgraph may vary depending on
the deployment method or operating system. The handling of the
`QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST` environment variable [varies by operating
system](#troubleshoot-connection-issues). </Callout>


{<h3 className="custom-header">Download and install Memgraph Lab</h3>}

Visit the [Download Hub](https://memgraph.com/download/#individual) and download
the Memgraph Lab desktop application. You can install Memgraph Lab by
double-clicking the downloaded installer and following the instructions.

If you downloaded Memgraph Lab on Linux, you can execute:

```
sudo dpkg -i MemgraphLab-x.x.x.deb
```

<Callout type="info"> If you encounter a security warning while installing
Memgraph Lab on **Windows**, click on **More info** and verify that Memgraph is
listed as the Publisher by clicking on **Run anyway**. </Callout>

</Steps>

## Install Memgraph Lab with Docker

Running Memgraph Lab in a Docker container provides a convenient and isolated
environment for managing graph data. Follow these steps to get started:

<Steps>
{<h3 className="custom-header">Pull the Memgraph Lab Docker image</h3>}

Before running Memgraph Lab, ensure that you have
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. Then, pull the latest Memgraph Lab
image using the following command:

```
docker pull memgraph/lab:latest
```

{<h3 className="custom-header">Start the container</h3>}

To start Memgraph Lab in a Docker container, run:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name lab memgraph/lab
```

Once the container is up you can access Memgraph Lab on
`localhost:3000`.

</Steps>

<Callout>
When running Memgraph Lab with Docker or Docker Compose, you can
[configure it using the environment variables](/memgraph-lab/fundamentals/configuration).
</Callout>

## Custom base path

Starting from the version `2.19.0`, Memgraph Lab allows you to set up Memgraph
Lab with a custom base path for the web application when running it in Docker.
This configuration is especially beneficial when using a reverse proxy like
NGINX to manage access to multiple applications.

### Configure the base path

To use this feature, you can define the environment variable `BASE_PATH` when
starting Memgraph Lab. For example, you can set `BASE_PATH` to `/mylab`, and
Memgraph Lab will be accessible at that base path (e.g. `localhost:3000/mylab`).

When running Memgraph Lab in Docker, specify the `BASE_PATH` environment
variable. For example:

```
docker run -e BASE_PATH=mylab -p 3000:3000 memgraph/lab
```

This starts Memgraph Lab on port 3000 and sets the base path to `/mylab`.

### Configure NGINX for reverse proxy

Here is an example nginx.conf for redirecting requests to Memgraph Lab:

```
# nginx.conf
events {}

http {
  server {
    listen 8080;

    location /mylab/ {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/mylab/;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

      # WebSocket specific headers
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation of key configurations:
- **`location`**: This should match the base path. In the example above, base path
  is `/mylab`, and location is `/mylab/`.
- **`proxy_pass`**: This should match the Memgraph Lab host and include the same
  base path as defined in `BASE_PATH`. In the example above, the base path is
  `/mylab`, and proxy_pass is `http://localhost:3000/mylab/`.
- **WebSocket headers**: These headers ensure WebSocket communication, such as the
  Logs feature in the Lab UI, works correctly. Include `proxy_http_version 1.1`,
  `proxy_set_header Upgrade` and `proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"`.

<Callout>

Special Note for Docker Networking: If both Memgraph Lab and the NGINX
server are running on the same machine, but you access them using Docker,
you can use `host.docker.internal` in proxy_pass instead of `localhost`.

For example:

```
proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:3000/mylab/;
```

</Callout>

### Access Memgraph Lab

After configuring the above settings, Memgraph Lab will be
accessible via the reverse proxy at:

```
http://<nginx-server-address>:8080/mylab/
```

Replace `<nginx-server-address>` with the actual address of your
NGINX server.

## Custom SSL certificate

Memgraph Lab supports using custom SSL certificates, ensuring secure communication over HTTPS. To set up 
SSL on Memgraph Lab you will need to configure a Dockerfile using a valid SSL certificate.

### Generate SSL certificates

There are various options to generate SSL certificates. Check out the steps on
how to do that with [OpenSSL](#openssl) and [Let's Encrypt](#lets-encrypt). 

{<h3 className="custom-header">OpenSSL</h3>}

[OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) is a widely used tool for
generating SSL certificates. You can create a self-signed certificate using the
following commands:

1. Generate a private key:
  ```bash
    openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
  ```

2. Generate a self-signed certificate:
  ```bash
    openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
  ```

However, this option has an expiration date and is not signed by a publicly trusted 
[certificate authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), which means 
you will most likely receive a security warning from your browser while using it.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Let's Encrypt</h3>}

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a free, automated, and open certificate authority 
that provides SSL certificates. You can use tools like Certbot to obtain and install certificates. 
To use Let's Encrypt:

1. Install Certbot.
2. Run Certbot to obtain your certificates:
  ```bash
    sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
  ```

This will generate your SSL certificate and key, typically located in 
`/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/`.

### Dockerfile setup

To run Memgraph Lab with custom SSL certificates, you need to create a 
Dockerfile that specifies how to build the Docker image with your certificates.

You will need to set the `SSL_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_KEY_PATH` environment variables 
to override the default `./ssl/` path used by Lab running in the container to 
determine the SSL certificate location. After that, you should copy your certificates
(located in the `ssl` folder at the same location as your `Dockerfile`, for example) 
into the container at the specified path.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Example Dockerfile</h3>}

```docker
FROM memgraph/lab:latest

# Environment variables
ENV SSL_IS_ENABLED=true
ENV SSL_CERT_PATH=./myssl/cert.pem
ENV SSL_KEY_PATH=./myssl/key.pem

# COPY source_on_your_machine destination_in_container
COPY ssl/ ./myssl/

EXPOSE 3000
```

{<h3 className="custom-header">Build and run the Docker container</h3>}

1. **Create the SSL Directory**: Make sure your SSL certificate and key are placed 
in a directory specified as `COPY` source in your Dockerfile.

2. **Build the Docker Image**: Run the following command to build your Docker image:
   `docker build -t memgraph-lab-ssl .`

3. **Run the Docker Container**: Start the container using the following command:
   `docker run -p 3000:3000 memgraph-lab-ssl`

4. **Access Memgraph Lab**: You can now access Memgraph Lab in your web browser at 
`https://localhost:3000`. Ensure to configure your browser to trust the self-signed 
certificate if you are using one.
