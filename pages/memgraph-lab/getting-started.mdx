# Getting Started with Memgraph Lab

The **Getting started** section provides an overview of the key steps needed to set up and use Memgraph Lab effectively. This section will guide you through deployment and installation, connection types and data import. Each topic is covered briefly here, with links to detailed subsections for further guidance.

## Deployment and installation

To start using Memgraph Lab, you need to install it and ensure that Memgraph is running. You can deploy Memgraph Lab in multiple ways:

- [**Using Docker**](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker): Quickly set up Memgraph and Memgraph Lab with a single command.
- [**Desktop application**](https://memgraph.com/download/#individual): Installable on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Web application**: Accessible via https://lab.memgraph.com for public Memgraph instances.

For a complete installation guide, visit the [Deployment and installation](/memgraph-lab/getting-started/deployment-and-installation) section.

## Connection types

Memgraph Lab provides multiple ways to connect to a Memgraph database, depending on your deployment setup:

- **Standalone instance**: Establish a direct connection to a single Memgraph database instance, ideal for local development and small-scale deployments.
- [**Main or replica instance**](/clustering/replication): Manually connect to either the main instance, which handles write operations or a replica instance for read operations.
- [**HA cluster with automatic failover**](/clustering/high-availability): Connect to a High Availability cluster where automatic failover ensures seamless transitions between instances, providing increased reliability.

For detailed instructions on configuring and using each connection type, visit the [Connection types](/memgraph-lab/getting-started/connection-type section.

## Data import

Once connected, you may need to import data into Memgraph. Memgraph Lab supports multiple data import methods:

[TODO: update links]  
- [**CSV file import tool**](/memgraph-lab/getting-started/data-import): Load structured data from CSV files using the built-in CSV import tool, making it easy to bring in tabular data.
- **CYPHERL file import**: Use Cypher queries to manually insert, update or modify data directly within Memgraph Lab.
- **Streaming data**: Integrate real-time data sources, such as Kafka or Pulsar, to continuously ingest and analyze data as it arrives.

For a detailed guide on loading data, visit the [Data import](/memgraph-lab/getting-started/data-import) section.
