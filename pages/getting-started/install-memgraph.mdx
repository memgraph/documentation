# Install Memgraph

Memgraph offers various Docker images, but when you're developing or if you're
new to Memgraph we recommend using the `memgraph-platform` image. It includes
the database and all the tools you might need to analyze your data, such as
command-line interface [mgconsole](/getting-started/cli), web interface
[Memgraph Lab](/data-visualization) and a complete set of algorithms within a
[MAGE](/advanced-algorithms) library. 

With the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) running in the
background, run the following command in the console:
 
```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

You can stop the instance with `docker stop memgraph` and start it with `docker
start memgraph` commands.

Once you're ready to go to production you can choose to use the `memgraph-mage`
Docker image that includes the database and the graph algrithms, or just run the
database using the `memgraph` image.

Other installation options are also available.
