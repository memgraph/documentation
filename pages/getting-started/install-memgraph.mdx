# Install Memgraph

Memgraph can be installed on various systems, but the most common way of running
it is using Docker. If you're new to Memgraph we recommend running [Memgraph
Platform](#quick-start), a multi-container application. It includes the database
and all the tools you might need to analyze your data, such as command-line
interface [mgconsole](/getting-started/cli), web interface [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization) and a complete set of algorithms within a
[MAGE](/advanced-algorithms) library.

<Callout type="info">
Memgraph Platform is no longer a single-container application. Before (Memgraph
< 2.14), Memgraph Platform was a separate Docker image released on Docker Hub.
This image is no longer supported, because having database service and client
service in the same container is not a good practice. Still, with Memgraph Lab
being released on Docker Hub, it is possible to run Memgraph MAGE and Lab as two
separate services, and in that way, running Memgraph Platform as a
multi-container application with [Docker
Compose](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker-compose).
</Callout>

## Quick start

If you want to quickly try out **Memgraph Platform** (Memgraph database + MAGE
library + Memgraph Lab) for the first time, do the following:

<Steps>

{<h3>Install Docker</h3>}
Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is running in the
background. 

{<h3>Run Memgraph Platform</h3>}
Depending on your operating system, execute the appropriate command
in the console:

<Tabs items={['Linux/macOS', 'Windows']}>
<Tab>
<CodeSnippet code="curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh" page="install-memgraph" os="linux/macOS"/>
</Tab>
<Tab>
<CodeSnippet code="iwr https://windows.memgraph.com | iex" page="install-memgraph" os="windows"/>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

The above command runs a script that downloads a [Docker Compose
file](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph-platform/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
to your system, builds and starts `memgraph-mage` and `memgraph-lab`
Docker services in two separate containers.
</Steps>

The above installation process is a quick start, but make sure you explore other
[installation options](/getting-started/install-memgraph#installation-options)
and choose the preferred way of running Memgraph in your environment.

## Installation options

The quick start will accelerate your first steps with Memgraph. If you plan on
using Memgraph for your project, it's best to familiarize yourself with the
installation options and pick the preferred one.

You don't want to bother with installation? Done! <br/> Register and run a
[Memgraph Cloud](https://memgraph.com/cloud) instance with a 2-week trial
period.

## System requirements

Below are minimum and recommended system requirements for installing Memgraph.

|         | Minimum  | Recommended                    |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| CPU     | Server or desktop processor: <br/> Intel Xeon <br/> AMD Opteron/Epyc <br/> ARM machines or Apple M1 <br/> Amazon Graviton | Server processor: <br/> Intel Xeon <br/> AMD Opteron/Epyc <br/> ARM machines or Apple M1 <br/> Amazon Graviton |
| RAM     | 1 GB     | ≥ 16 GB ECC                    |
| Disk    | 1 GB     | equally as RAM                 |
| Cores   | 1 vCPU   | ≥ 8 vCPUs (≥ 4 physical cores) |
| Network | 100 Mbps | ≥ 1 Gbps                       |

The disk is used for storing database [durability
files](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup) - snapshots and write-ahead
logs.
