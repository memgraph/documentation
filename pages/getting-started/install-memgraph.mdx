# Install Memgraph

If you're new to Memgraph or you're in a developing stage, we
recommend using the Memgraph Platform. Besides the database, it also

includes all the tools you might need to analyze your data, such as command-line
interface [mgconsole](/getting-started/cli), web interface [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization) and a complete set of algorithms within a
[MAGE](/advanced-algorithms) library.

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is running in the
background. Depending on your operating system, execute the appropriate command
in the console:

**For Linux and macOS:**

<CodeSnippet code="curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh" page="install-memgraph" os="linux/macOS"/>

**For Windows:**

<CodeSnippet code="iwr https://windows.memgraph.com | iex" page="install-memgraph" os="windows"/>

Once you're ready to go to production you can choose to use the `memgraph-mage`
Docker image that includes the database and the graph library, or run the
database only, using the `memgraph` image.

Other installation options are also available.

period.

The disk is used for storing database [durability
files](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup) - snapshots and write-ahead
logs.
