# Install Memgraph

If you're new to Memgraph or you're in a developing stage, we
recommend using the Memgraph Paltform. Besides the database, it also
includes all the tools you might need to analyze your data, such as command-line
interface [mgconsole](/getting-started/cli), web interface [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization) and a complete set of algorithms within a
[MAGE](/advanced-algorithms) library.

With the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) running in the
background, run the following command in the console:

<CodeSnippet code="curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh" page="install-memgraph"/>

Once you're ready to go to production you can choose to use the `memgraph-mage`
Docker image that includes the database and the graph library, or run the
database only, using the `memgraph` image.

Other installation options are also available.

period.
