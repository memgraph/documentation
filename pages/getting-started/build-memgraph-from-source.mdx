# Building Memgraph from source

Follow this guide  if you want to compile a Memgraph from a source. Here you
will find all the necessary steps, including setting up the necessary toolchain,
compiling the code, and running Memgraph.

<Callout>

Memgraph uses `git` for source version control. You will need to install `git`
on your machine before you can download the source code.

</Callout>

If you are using Mac M1 or above, please check our [MacOS Lima Compilation
Guide](https://www.notion.so/MacOS-Lima-Compilation-Guide-eae1e9dcef5740579c5a41075b8f499b?pvs=21)
first.

ARM build instructions are located at [Building Memgraph for ARM64
CPU](https://www.notion.so/Building-Memgraph-for-ARM64-CPU-a73d243c3c7c4daa94cb574ca8ff9516?pvs=21)
document.

## Obtaining the Source Code

After installing `git`, you are now ready to fetch your own copy of the Memgraph
source code. Run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:memgraph/memgraph.git
```

The above will create a `memgraph` directory and put all source code there.

## Downloading the dependencies

Before you can compile Memgraph, you first need to download its dependencies

In your terminal, position yourself in the obtained memgraph directory.

```bash
cd memgraph
```

Building Memgraph depends on some system-wide packages. The installation scripts
can be found under `environment/os/`. The directory contains a dependencies
management script for each supported operating system.

```bash
sudo ./environment/os/install_deps.sh install TOOLCHAIN_RUN_DEPS
sudo ./environment/os/install_deps.sh install MEMGRAPH_BUILD_DEPS
```

The first command installs all the packages necessary for the Memgraph toolchain
to work correctly. The second command installs the system-wide packages that are
not necessary for the toolchain but are required by Memgraph.

<Callout>
    
    Based on your OS, version and architecture, execute appropriate scripts (e.g., on **Debian 11**, NOTE: the following commands/scripts are located under [memgraph repository](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/tree/master/environment/os):
    
    ```bash
    sudo ./environment/os/debian-11.sh install TOOLCHAIN_RUN_DEPS
    sudo ./environment/os/debian-11.sh install MEMGRAPH_BUILD_DEPS
    ```
    
    For ARM look for `-arm` in the script name (e.g., on Ubuntu 24.04 with Apple M processor):
    
    ```bash
    sudo ./environment/os/ubuntu-24.04-arm.sh install TOOLCHAIN_RUN_DEPS
    sudo ./environment/os/ubuntu-24.04-arm.sh install MEMGRAPH_BUILD_DEPS
    ```
</Callout> 

Once everything is installed, you can proceed to the compilation.

## Compiling

Memgraph is compiled using our own custom toolchain that can be obtained from
the toolchain repository.  All our tools used in the development of Memgraph are
manually built for each OS and collected in an archive. Please refer to the
[`memgraph/environment`](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/tree/master/environment)
folder for all related code.

<Callout>

Keep in mind, `cargo` is also required to build Memgraph, follow the [official
Rust installation
guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

</Callout>

You should read the
[Toolchain](https://www.notion.so/Toolchain-37c37c84382149a58d09b2ccfcb410d7?pvs=21)
to install the appropriate toolchain for your distribution.

### Toolchain installation procedure

Download the toolchain for your operating system from one of the following links:

- [CentOS 9](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deps.memgraph.io/toolchain-v6/toolchain-v6-binaries-centos-9-x86_64.tar.gz)
- [CentOS 10](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deps.memgraph.io/toolchain-v6/toolchain-v6-binaries-centos-10-x86_64.tar.gz)
- [Debian 11 (x86_64)](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deps.memgraph.io/toolchain-v6/toolchain-v6-binaries-debian-11-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Debian 11 (arm64)](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deps.memgraph.io/toolchain-v6/toolchain-v6-binaries-debian-11-arm64.tar.gz)
- [Debian 12 (x86_64)](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deps.memgraph.io/toolchain-v6/toolchain-v6-binaries-debian-12-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Debian 12 (arm64)](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deps.memgraph.io/toolchain-v6/toolchain-v6-binaries-debian-12-arm64.tar.gz)
- [Ubuntu 22.04 (x86_64)](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deps.memgraph.io/toolchain-v6/toolchain-v6-binaries-ubuntu-22.04-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Ubuntu 24.04 (x86_64)](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deps.memgraph.io/toolchain-v6/toolchain-v6-binaries-ubuntu-24.04-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Ubuntu 24.04 (arm64)](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/deps.memgraph.io/toolchain-v6/toolchain-v6-binaries-ubuntu-24.04-arm64.tar.gz)

Extract the toolchain with the following command:

```bash
sudo tar xzvfm {{toolchain-archive}}.tar.gz -C /opt
```

<Callout>

After you have installed the toolchain, you should read the instructions for the
toolchain in the toolchain install directory (`/opt/toolchain-v6/README.md`)
and install dependencies that are necessary to run the toolchain.

</Callout>

If you have not already installed toolchain dependencies, please check and
install required toolchain runtime dependencies by executing

```bash
sudo ./environment/os/install_deps.sh check TOOLCHAIN_RUN_DEPS
sudo ./environment/os/install_deps.sh install TOOLCHAIN_RUN_DEPS
```

<Callout>

    Based on your OS, version and architecture, execute appropriate scripts (e.g., on Debian 11, NOTE: the following commands/scripts are located under [memgraph repository](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph)):

    ```bash
    sudo ./environment/os/debian-11.sh check TOOLCHAIN_RUN_DEPS
    sudo ./environment/os/debian-11.sh install TOOLCHAIN_RUN_DEPS
    ```
    
    For ARM look for `-arm` in script name (e.g. on Ubuntu 24.04 with Apple M processor):
    
    ```bash
    sudo ./environment/os/ubuntu-24.04-arm.sh check TOOLCHAIN_RUN_DEPS
    sudo ./environment/os/ubuntu-24.04-arm.sh install TOOLCHAIN_RUN_DEPS
    ```
</Callout>    

When you want to compile Memgraph, you should activate the toolchain using the
prepared toolchain activation script that is also described in the toolchain
`README`.

You must activate the toolchain every time you want to compile Memgraph:

```bash
source /opt/toolchain-v6/activate
```

In case you need to deactivate the toolchain, you can run:

```bash
deactivate
```

<Callout>

If you put the toolchain on some other path, it’s possible to say to the `cmake`
the root is there, that is done by [setting `MG_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT` environment
variable](https://www.notion.so/If-you-put-toolchain-on-some-other-path-it-s-possible-to-say-to-the-cmake-there-the-root-is-that-s-e45311092e9a454eb73c720bf9ef04c1?pvs=21).

That’s also useful where you have different versions of libraries under system
compare to what the Memgraph build process needs. 

</Callout>

## Installing Memgraph dependencies

In addition to the system-wide dependencies, Memgraph requires certain libraries
to be built locally. The proper setup of these libraries should be checked by
running the `init` script:

```bash
./init
```

<Callout>

Make sure to activate the toolchain before the `./init` command.

</Callout>

With all of the dependencies installed and the build environment set-up, you
need to configure the build system. To do that, execute the following:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
```

If only Memgraph binary is required you can run build using:

```jsx
make -j$(nproc) memgraph
```

If you need to compile the whole project (e.g., unit tests) run: 

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Running Memgraph

After the compilation, verify that Memgraph works:

```bash
./memgraph --version
```

The unit tests can be run using

```bash
ctest -R unit -j$(nproc)
```
