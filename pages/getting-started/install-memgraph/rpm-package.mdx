## Installation guide

<Steps>

### Download Memgraph RPM Package

Downloaded the latest Memgraph RPM Package from the [Memgraph Download
Hub](https://memgraph.com/download/).

links](/getting-started/install-memgraph/direct-download-links) to get the
latest Memgraph packages. 

For example:
```console
sudo wget https://download.memgraph.com/memgraph/v2.9.0/debian-11/memgraph_2.9.0-1_amd64.deb
```

```

**NOTE:** Please take care of the SELinux config. The easiest way of
running Memgraph is to disable SELinux by executing `setenforce 0`. If that's
not an option, please configure system properly.
</Callout>

If you run into any troubles while installing Memgraph, contact us on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/memgraph).

### Start Memgraph

After successful installation, Memgraph can be started as a service using the
following command:

```console
systemctl start memgraph
```

To verify that Memgraph is running, run the following command:

```console
journalctl --unit memgraph
```

If successful, you should receive an output similar to the following:

```console
You are running Memgraph vX.X.X
```

If you want the Memgraph service to start automatically on each startup, run the
following command:

```console
systemctl enable memgraph
```

### Connect to the database

To [query](/querying) the database from the console, you need to install
[`mgconsole`](/getting-started/cli). 

You can also connect to the database using one of the [client
libraries](/client-libraries) or visual-user interface [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization).

</Steps>

## Stop Memgraph

To shut down the Memgraph server, issue the following command:

```console
systemctl stop memgraph
```

## Configuration

The Memgraph configuration is available in `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`. If the
configuration file is altered, Memgraph needs to be restarted. Check all the
configuration options in the [configuration
settings](/configuration/configuration-settings). 

## Where to next?
