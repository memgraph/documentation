## Installation guide

<Steps>

{<h3>Download Memgraph RPM Package</h3>}

Downloaded the latest Memgraph RPM Package from the [Memgraph Download
Hub](https://memgraph.com/download/).

You can also use [direct download
links](/getting-started/install-memgraph/direct-download-links) to get the
latest Memgraph packages. 

For example:

<CodeSnippet code="sudo wget https://download.memgraph.com/memgraph/v2.9.0/debian-11/memgraph_2.9.0-1_amd64.deb" page="install-memgraph/rpm-package"/>

{<h3>Install Memgraph</h3>}

After downloading the Memgraph RPM package, you can install it by issuing the
following command:

```console
sudo yum --nogpgcheck localinstall /path-to/memgraph-<version>.rpm
```

<Callout type="info">
**NOTE:** Please take care of the SELinux config. The easiest way of
running Memgraph is to disable SELinux by executing `setenforce 0`. If that's
not an option, please configure system properly.
</Callout>

If you run into any troubles while installing Memgraph, contact us on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/memgraph).

{<h3>Start Memgraph</h3>}

After successful installation, Memgraph can be started as a service using the
following command:

```console
systemctl start memgraph
```

To verify that Memgraph is running, run the following command:

```console
journalctl --unit memgraph
```

If successful, you should receive an output similar to the following:

```console
You are running Memgraph vX.X.X
```

If you want the Memgraph service to start automatically on each startup, run the
following command:

```console
systemctl enable memgraph
```

{<h3>Connect to the database</h3>}

To [query](/querying) the database from the console, you need to install
[`mgconsole`](/getting-started/cli). 

You can also connect to the database using one of the [client
libraries](/client-libraries) or visual-user interface [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization).

</Steps>

## Stop Memgraph

To shut down the Memgraph server, issue the following command:

```console
systemctl stop memgraph
```

## Start Memgraph

## Configuration

<Callout type="info">

If you're experiencing issues related to the maximum number of memory map areas,
you can resolve them by [adjusting the `vm.max_map_count`
parameter](https://memgraph.com/docs/configuration/system-configuration#increasing-memory-map-areas). 

</Callout>

The Memgraph configuration is available in `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`. If the
configuration file is altered, Memgraph needs to be restarted. Check all the
configuration options in the [configuration
settings](/configuration/configuration-settings).
