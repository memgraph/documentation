# Install Memgraph on Debian

Install and run Memgraph on Debian 10 or Debian 11.

<Callout type="warning"> 
Newer versions of Memgraph might not be backward
compatible with older versions and you might not be able to load storage
snapshots between different versions. In that case, please contact the Memgraph
team and we'll help with the migration as much as possible.
 </Callout>

## Installation guide

<Steps>

### Download Memgraph Debian Package

Downloaded the latest Memgraph Debian Package from the [Memgraph Download Hub](https://memgraph.com/download/).

You can also use [direct download
links](/getting-started/install-memgraph/direct-download-links) to get the
latest Memgraph packages. 

For example:
```console
sudo wget https://download.memgraph.com/memgraph/v2.9.0/debian-11/memgraph_2.9.0-1_amd64.deb
```

### Install Memgraph

After downloading Memgraph as a Debian package, install it by running the
following:

```console
sudo dpkg -i /path-to/memgraph_<version>.deb
```

<Callout type="info"> 

Why use sudo? 

In order to perform some actions on your operating system like installing new
software, you may need **superuser** privileges (commonly called **root**).

</Callout>

#### Troubleshooting

**Unable to use `sudo`**

If you encounter the following error:

```
-bash: sudo: command not found
```

Install `sudo` with:

```
apt update -y
apt install sudo -y
```

**Unable to install the Memgraph package with `dpkg`**

While running the following `dpkg` command:

```bash
dpkg -i /path-to/memgraph_<version>.deb
```

you may encounter errors that resemble the following:

```console
dpkg: error processing package memgraph (--install): dependency problems -
leaving unconfigured Errors were encountered while processing: memgraph
```

These errors indicate that you donâ€™t have all of the necessary dependencies
installed. To install the missing dependencies and finish the installation,
issue the following command:

```console
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### Verify that Memgraph is running

To verify that Memgraph is running, run the following:

```console
sudo journalctl --unit memgraph
```

If successful, you should receive an output similar to the following:

```console
You are running Memgraph vX.X.X
```

If the Memgraph database instance is not running, you can start it explicitly:

```console
sudo systemctl start memgraph
```

#### Troubleshooting

When you start a Memgraph instance, you may see the following list of notes in
your terminal:

```console
You are running Memgraph v1.4.0-community

NOTE: Please install networkx to be able to use graph_analyzer module. Using Python:
3.8.2 (default, Jul 16 2020, 14:00:26)
[GCC 9.3.0]

NOTE: Please install networkx to be able to use Memgraph NetworkX wrappers. Using Python:
3.8.2 (default, Jul 16 2020, 14:00:26)
[GCC 9.3.0]

NOTE: Please install networkx, numpy, scipy to be able to use proxied NetworkX algorithms. E.g., CALL nxalg.pagerank(...).
Using Python:

```

If you wish to work with built-in NetworkX modules in Memgraph, you need to
install the following Python libraries:
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)

For more information on how to install Python libraries in Linux, follow the
[Installing Packages
guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/). If you are
not interested in working with query modules that depend on these libraries, you
can ignore the warnings.

If you run into any troubles while installing Memgraph, contact us on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/memgraph).

### Connect to the database

To [query](/querying) the database from the console, you need to install
[`mgconsole`](/getting-started/cli). 

You can also connect to the database using one of the [client
libraries](/client-libraries) or visual-user interface [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization).
