# Install Memgraph with Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a service that uses OS-level virtualization
to deliver software in packages that are called
[containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).

Memgraph uses Docker because it is:

- Flexible
- Lightweight
- Portable - you can build locally or deploy to the cloud
- Runs on all platforms - Windows, Linux and macOS
- Deploys in Kubernetes

We recommend you install **Memgraph Platform** Docker image which contains:
- **Memgraph** - the database that holds your data
- **[Memgraph Lab](/data-visualization)** - visual user interface for running queries and visualizing
  graph data
- **[mgconsole](/getting-started/cli)** - command-line interface for running queries
- **[MAGE](/advanced-algorithms)** - graph algorithms and modules library

## Install Memgraph Platform

<Steps>

{<h3>Install Docker Desktop</h3>}

Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) by following the instructions available on their site. 

{<h3>Install and run Memgraph</h3>}

Open a terminal and use the following command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

After downloading the image, Memgraph will install and if the installation was
successful, you should see a message similar to the following:

```nocopy

```

Memgraph will start listing the logs, and don't worry about the inital errors
and warnings as at this point, they are of informative nature. 

{<h3>Connect to the instance</h3>}

You can connect to the Memgraph instance using the command-line interface
[mgconsole](/getting-started/cli) by running the following command in a new
terminal:

```terminal
docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole
```

When the mgconsole starts, you can query the database: 

```nocopy
C:\Users\Vlasta>docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole
mgconsole 1.3
Connected to 'memgraph://127.0.0.1:7687'
Type :help for shell usage
Quit the shell by typing Ctrl-D(eof) or :quit
memgraph>
```

You can also connect to Memgraph using the [Memgraph Lab web
application](/data-visualization/user-manual) available within the
`memgraph-platform` Docker image by visiting `localhost:3000`.

![](/pages/getting-started/lab.png)

To start using Memgraph in your application, use one of the [client
libraries](/client-libraries) and follow their getting started guide.

</Steps>

### Running individual tools from Memgraph Platform image

You can run only the **Memgraph database instance** from the Memgraph Platform image
using the following command: 

```terminal
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-platform -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord-memgraph-only.conf
```

You can run only **mgconsole** web application from the Memgraph Platform
image using the following command in Linux:

```terminal
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

You can run only **mgconsole** web application from the Memgraph Platform
image using the following command in Windows and macOS:

```terminal
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform --host host.docker.internal
```

You can run only the **Memgraph Lab** web application from the Memgraph Platform
image using the following command: 

```terminal
docker run -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord-lab-only.conf
```

### Stop and start the instance

You can stop the instance with `docker stop memgraph`.

You can restart the instance with `docker start memgraph`

## Other available Docker images

All Memgraph Docker images are availble at [Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph). There you will find exact Docker image
tags you can use to install Memgraph with. 

The main repositories are: 

- `memgraph/memgraph` includes Memgraph database and mgconsole
- `memgraph/memgraph-mage` includes Memgraph database, mgconsole and MAGE (check the docs)
    - `memgraph/memgraph-mage` + cuGraph - includes Memgraph database, mgconsole, MAGE and NVIDIA cuGraph GPU-powered graph algorithms
- `memgraph/memgraph-platform` includes Memgraph database, mgconsole, MAGE and Memgraph Lab
    - `memgraph/memgraph-platform` also includes a version of image without MAGE (look for the tag using only `memgraph` and `lab` keywords).


## Install Memgraph using other Docker images

To install Memgraph from any image, you need to adjust the `docker run` command
in Step 2. 

`memgraph/memgraph-mage` + cuGraph have a specific installation process. 

### `memgraph/memgraph`

Install and run the `memgraph` image using the following command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph
```

You can connect to the Memgraph instance using the command-line interface
[mgconsole](/getting-started/cli) by running the following command in a new

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

### `memgraph/memgraph-mage` + cuGraph

<Steps>

{<h3>Check prerequisites</h3>}

To be able to run cuGraph analytics, make sure you have compatible
infrastructure first. The exact system requirements are available at the [NVIDIA
RAPIDS site](https://docs.rapids.ai/install#requirements), and include an NVIDIA
Pascal (or better) GPU and up-to-date CUDA & NVIDIA drivers.

You will also need to install:

- Official [NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) for your operating system.
- To run on NVIDIA-powered GPUs, RAPIDS requires Docker CE v19.03+ and [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).
- Legacy Docker CE v17-18 users requie the [nvidia-docker2 package](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation-(version-2.0)).

{<h3>Install and run Memgraph</h3>}

Install and run Memgraph using the following command:

```console
docker run --rm --gpus all -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage:1.3-cugraph-22.02-cuda-11.5
```

Check the latest versions of cuGraph Docker images at [Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph), by searching the
`memgraph/memgraph-mage` repository with the `cugraph` keyword.

You can connect to the Memgraph instance using the command-line interface
[mgconsole](/getting-started/cli) by running the following command in a new
terminal:

```terminal
docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole
```

You can also connect to Memgraph instance using the [Memgraph Platform desktop
application](/data-visualization/user-manual), available for download from
[Memgraph's Download Hub](https://memgraph.com/download). 

To start using Memgraph in your application, use one of the [client
libraries](/client-libraries) and follow their getting started guide.

</Steps>

## Configuration options

To learn about all the configuration options, check out the [configuration
settings](/configuration/configuration-settings).

When using Docker, you can specify the configuration options in the `docker run`
command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH="--log-level=TRACE" memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

When working with Memgraph Platform, you should pass configuration flags inside
of environment variables, while all the other Docker images use regular
configuration flags.

For example, you can start the `memgraph` image with `docker run
memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE`, but you should start the
`memgraph-platform` with `docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e
MEMGRAPH="--bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE" memgraph/memgraph-platform`.

## Troubleshooting

### Issues with loading Memgraph
```console
docker load -i memgraph.tar.gz
```
{<h4>Error during connect:<br/> <code>This error may indicate that the docker daemon is not running.</code></h4>}

Run the Docker Desktop application and wait for it to load fully.

{<h4>Error response from daemon:<br/> <code>open \\.\pipe\docker_engine_linux: The system cannot find the file specified.</code></h4>}

Reload the Docker Desktop application and wait for it to load fully.

{<h4>Unsupported OS Linux</h4>}

You need to download the [Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package),
and enable experimental features in Docker Desktop, under *Settings* -> *Docker
Engine*, change *experimental* to *true*.

### Issues when connecting to Memgraph

```console
docker run memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

While this command will start a Memgraph instance, not publishing the port will
cause problems when trying to connect to the database via **Memgraph Lab** or
**mgconsole**. To avoid this, you should publish the
container's port to the host using the `-p` flag and by specifying the port:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

### Issues with connecting `mgconsole` to the database

```console
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform --host HOST
```

Although unlikely, sometimes there are issues with connecting **mgconsole** to
the Docker Container’s IP address because it is running on a custom IP rather
than `localhost`. This problem is most often accompanied with the following
error:

```console
Connection failure: Couldn't connect to 127.0.0.1:7687!
```

To fix this issue, just replace `HOST` from the first command with
`host.docker.internal`. To find out more about networking in Docker, take a look
at [Networking features in Docker Desktop for
Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/) guide or
[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/) guide .

### Issues with the IP address

Although unlikely, some users might experience minor difficulties after the
Docker installation. Instead of running on `localhost`, a Docker container for
Memgraph may be running on a custom IP address. Fortunately, that IP address can
be found as follows:

**1.** Determine the ID of the Memgraph Container by issuing the
command `docker ps`. The user should get an output similar to the following:

```console
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED
9397623cd87e    memgraph    "/usr/lib/memgraph/m…"   2 seconds ago
```

At this point, it is important to remember the container ID of the Memgraph
Image. In our case, that is `9397623cd87e`.

**2.** Use the this ID to retrieve the IP address of the Container:

```console
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e
```

The command above will yield the IP address that should be used when connecting
to Memgraph via **Memgraph Lab** or **mgconsole** as described in
the [querying](/) section. Just replace
`HOST` from the following command with the appropriate IP address:

```console
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform --host HOST
```

## Work with Docker

If you are new to Docker, this guide will help you get a grasp of Docker and
make it easier to accomplish tasks within Memgraph. After installing Docker, all
commands are run from the command-line tool of your preference.

### Download the Memgraph Docker image

Images are downloaded using the `docker pull` command followed by the name of
the Docker image. We encourage you to use Memgraph Platform as it includes
everything you might need while making the best of Memgraph.

To download the latest Memgraph Platform image, run:

```
docker pull memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

All Memgraph Docker images are availble at [Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph). There you will find exact Docker image
tags you can downalod and use to install Memgraph with. 

### Architecture of Docker container running Memgraph

The picture below shows the architecture of the Memgraph Docker ecosystem.

![](/pages/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker/docker-architecture.png)

### Run a Memgraph Docker image

All images are started using the `docker run` command followed by various flags,
environment variables and configuration options.

The most common flags used while running Memgraph images are:

- publish ports: `-p 3000:3000`
- container name: `--name memgraph`
- set up configuration using environment variables in the case of the
  `memgraph-platform` image, or configuration flags using the `memgraph` or
  `memgraph-mage` image

A `docker run` command can look like this:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 [-p host_port:container_port] [--name container_name] [configuration] memgraph/image_name
```

#### Publish ports

Ports are published in order to allow services outside the container to be able
to connect to the container. When publishing ports, you need to define two ports
separated by a colon. The left side port stands for the **host port** and the
right side port is the **container port**.

The most common ports published while running Memgraph are:

- `-p 7687:7687` - connection to the database instance (the Bolt protocol uses
  this port by default)
- `-p 3000:3000` - connection to the Memgraph Lab application when running
  Memgraph Platform
- `-p 7444:7444` - connection to fetch log files from Memgraph Lab (only in
  version 2.0 and newer)

For example, if you are running two instances using the `memgraph-platform`
image and you want to connect to both instances using the Memgraph Lab
in-browser application. You would run the first instance with:

```
docker run -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

Because port `3000` is now taken, you need to change the left side
port (host ports):

```
docker run -p 7444:7444 -p 3001:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

To connect to the first instance, you should open Memgraph Lab in your browser
at `localhost:3000`, but the second instance is reachable at `localhost:3001`.

#### Container name

Upon creation, each container gets an ID. You can find out the container ID by
running the `docker ps` command, but you can also name the container using the
`--name` flag. Defining a name can be a handy way to add meaning to a container.
If you specify a name, you can use it when referencing the container within a
Docker network.

#### Set up the configuration

If you want a certain configuration setting to be applied during a single run,
you need to pass the configuration option within the `docker run` command
instead of changing the configuration file.

If you are working with the `memgraph-platform` image, you should pass
configuration options with environment variables.

For example, if you want to limit memory usage for the whole instance to 50 MiB
and set the log level to `TRACE`, pass the configuration like this:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 -p 7444:7444 -e MEMGRAPH="--memory-limit=50 --log-level=TRACE" memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

When you are working with `memgraph` or `memgraph-mage` images, you should pass
configuration options as arguments.

For example, if you want to limit memory usage for the whole instance to 50 MiB
and set the log level to `TRACE`, pass the configuration argument like this:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph --memory-limit=50 --log-level=TRACE
```

#### Specify volumes

Specifying a volume syncs the specified directory inside the Docker container as
a local directory and serves for durability. The `-v` flag is followed by the
name of the local directory separated from the path of the volume in the
container by a semicolon:

```
-v volume_name:volume_path
```

Named volumes handle data permissions so there shouldn't be any issue with data
permissions. 

Useful volumes you can specify while running Memgraph are:

- `-v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph` - directory containing data, enables data
  persistency
- `-v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph` - directory containing log files
- `-v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph` - directory containing the configuration file

The exact location of the local directories depends on your specific setup.

The configuration file can usually be found at
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mg_etc/_data/memgraph.conf` but you can also copy the
file from the Docker container, modify it and copy it back into the container.

The logs will be saved to the `mg_log` volume, and the directories can usually be
found in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`, but you can also view them in the Memgraph
Lab 2.0 (or newer) by publishing the port `7444`.

#### Specify bind mounts

Bind mounts are local directories or files that can be modified by other
processes other than Docker. Any changes made to these directories or files
locally will be reflected inside the Docker container and vice-versa. Also, a
bind mount will overwrite the content of the Docker container.

For example, if I have a `Data` directory on my `C:` disk, and I want to access
it from inside the container at `/usr/lib/memgraph/data`, I would run Docker
with the following `-v` flag.

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000  -v "C:/data":/usr/lib/memgraph/data memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

You can use bind mounts to transfer durability files such as snapshot or WAL
files inside the container to restore data, or CSV files you will use to import
data with `CSV LOAD` clause. 

Bind mounts do not handle data permissions which could cause issues with
permissions. 

### Stop container

Database instances are stopped by stopping the Docker container with the command
`docker stop`. To stop a container you need [to know the container's
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or [name](#container-name).

You can list all the containers you want to stop in one `docker stop` command:

```
docker stop CONTAINER1_ID CONTAINER2_ID CONTAINER3_NAME
```

### Start container

If you want to start a stopped container, list them using the following command: 

```
docker ps -a
```

Then start the container with: 
```
docker start <CONTAINER_ID> 
```

or 

```
docker start <CONTAINER_NAME> 
```

### Retrieve a Docker container ID

Run the following command:

```
docker ps
```

You should get an output similar to this:

```console
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                                                    NAMES
45fa0f86f826   memgraph/memgraph-platform   "/bin/sh -c '/usr/bi…"   21 hours ago   Up 21 hours   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7444->7444/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7687->7687/tcp   admiring_almeida
```

You can shorten this ID to 4 letters if the ID remains unique, for example,
`45fa`.

### Retrieve a Docker container IP address

To retrieve the Docker container IP address, first, you need [to retrieve its
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or use its [name](#container-name).

Then run the following command if the container ID is `9397623cd87e`.

```console
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e
```

### Browse files inside a Docker container

To browse files inside a Docker container, first, you need [to retrieve its
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or use its [name](#container-name).

Then run the following command if the container ID is `9397623cd87e`:

```
docker exec -it 9397623cd87e bash
```

To navigate through the container, use the following commands:

- `ls` - list all the directories and files
- `cd <directory>` - enter a directory
- `cd ..` - leave the directory
- `cat <file>` - list the content of a file

You don't have to write file and directory names in full, once you write enough
letters to have a unique string, press the `<TAB>` key.

### Copy files from and to a Docker container

To copy files from and to the Docker container, first, you need [to retrieve its
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or use its [name](#container-name).

1. Place yourself in the local directory where you want to copy the file.

2. Copy the file from the container to your current directory with the command:

  ```
  docker cp <CONTAINER ID>:<path_in_container> <local_file_name>
  ```

  Be sure to replace the `<CONTAINER ID>` parameter.

  The example below will copy the configuration file to the user's Desktop:

  ```
  C:\Users\Vlasta\Desktop>docker cp bb3de2634afe:/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf memgraph.conf
  ```

3. Copy the file from your current directory to the container with the command:

  ```
  docker cp  <local_file_name> <CONTAINER ID>:<path_in_container>
  ```

  Be sure to replace the `<CONTAINER ID>` parameter.

  The example below will replace the configuration file with the one from the
  user's Desktop:

  ```
  C:\Users\Vlasta\Desktop>docker cp memgraph.conf bb3de2634afe:/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf
  ```
