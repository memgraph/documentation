# Install Memgraph with Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a containerization platform that packages
software and its dependencies into isolated environments called containers.
Memgraph provides official Docker images to help you quickly set up the
database, tools and analytics. This guide walks you through installing Memgraph
with Docker in various configurations.

This page covers:
- [Quickstart](#quickstart): fastest way to run Memgraph with Docker.
- [Available Docker images](#available-docker-images): what each Docker image includes.
- [Using Docker Compose](#using-docker-compose): if you prefer a multi-containered setup
- [Install downloaded image](#install-from-a-downloaded-targz): Load Memgraph from a .tar.gz file.
- [Configuration](#configuration-options)
- [Running with cuGraph (Legacy)](#advanced-cugraph-support-legacy): GPU-accelerated support (no longer maintained).
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting): solutions for common problems.


## Quickstart

### Run Memgraph MAGE

```bash
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

This command launches **Memgraph MAGE**, the main Docker image which includes:
- **Memgraph database**
- [MAGE (Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions)](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms): a library of powerful,
  ready-to-use graph algorithms (e.g., PageRank, Community Detection)

### Connect via CLI

The simplest way to execute Cypher queries against Memgraph is through its command-line tool, **mgconsole**. If you're running Memgraph in Docker, you can start the CLI with:

```bash
docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole
```

This connects directly to your running Memgraph instance.

For more detailed instructions, visit our [CLI documentation](/getting-started/cli).

### Connect via Memgraph Lab

If you prefer more visual approach, **Memgraph Lab** offers a user-friendly UI
to interact with your data and run Cypher queries. You have two options:

**Option 1: Run Memgraph Lab via Docker**

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name lab memgraph/lab
```

Once running, open your browser and go to `localhost:3000` to start using
Memgraph Lab.

**Option 2: Download the app**

Alternatively, you can [download Memgraph Lab](https://memgraph.com/download)
and connect it to your existing Memgraph instance.

For more information, visit our [Memgraph Lab documentation](/memgraph-lab).


## Available Docker images

All Memgraph Docker images are available at [Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph). There you will find the exact Docker
image tags you can use to install Memgraph with. 

{<h3 className="custom-header">Core images</h3>}

| Image                     | Includes                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `memgraph/memgraph-mage` | Memgraph DB + CLI + MAGE library         |
| `memgraph/memgraph`      | Memgraph DB + CLI (no graph algorithms)  |

{<h3 className="custom-header">Standalone tools</h3>}


| Image                 | Description                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `memgraph/mgconsole` | CLI client to interact with Memgraph          |
| `memgraph/lab`       | Web interface for querying and visualization  |


{<h3 className="custom-header">Recommendation</h3>}

> Use `memgraph/memgraph-mage` unless you have a reason to use the slim or
> separate components.


## Using Docker Compose 

To manage Memgraph and its tools (e.g. Memgraph Lab) as a single app in a
multi-containered setup, use **Docker Compose**. 

Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  memgraph:
    image: memgraph/memgraph-mage
    ports:
      - "7687:7687"
      - "7444:7444"
  lab:
    image: memgraph/lab
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST: memgraph
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will launch both **Memgraph database** and **Memgraph Lab**.

We provided a basic setup in the example above, but for more details, visit our
[Docker Compose documentation](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker-compose).


## Install from a downloaded `.tar.gz`

If you've downloaded the Memgraph Docker image directly from the [Memgraph
download hub](https://memgraph.com/download), you'll receive a file named
similar to `memgraph-3.2.0-docker.tar.gz` (the exact file name varies based on
the version you've downloaded). 

To load this image into Docker, do the following:

<Steps>

{<h3 className="custom-header">Load the image into Docker</h3>}

Use the `docker load` command to load the
image into Docker:

```terminal
docker load -i memgraph-3.2.0-docker.tar.gz
```

{<h3 className="custom-header">Run the Memgraph image</h3>}

After loading the image, you can run it using the `docker run` command. Here’s
an example command to start the Memgraph Docker container:

```terminal
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph:3.2.0
```

</Steps>


## Configuration options

Memgraph accepts configuration options via command line. Example:

```bash
docker run memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE
```

For full configuration settings, refer to the Memgraph [Configuration docs](/database-management/configuration).

## Advanced: cuGraph Support (Legacy)

<Callout type="info">

cuGraph builds are no longer maintained since Memgraph MAGE v1.3. These
instructions are here as a reference for legacy installations.

</Callout>

To run GPU-accelerated graph analytics (if using an older version):
1. Ensure you have a Pascal+ NVIDIA GPU and required drivers.
2. Install:
    - Docker CE v19.03+
    - nvidia-container-toolkit

Run Memgraph MAGE + cuGraph (legacy):

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage:1.3-cugraph-22.02-cuda-11.5
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker not running?

- Launch Docker Desktop and wait for it to start.
- Run: `docker ps` to verify it's working.
- If needed, restart your .

### Memgraph Lab can't connect?

Connection issues between **Memgraph Lab** and **Memgraph** often depend on your
deployment method and operating system. The behavior of the
`QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST` environment variable varies by platform:

- **Mac & Windows:**
  Use `host.docker.internal` to allow Docker containers to communicate with
  services running on the host machine. Set this as the value of
  `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST` when running Memgraph Lab to connect to a host-based
  Memgraph instance:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST=host.docker.internal --name lab memgraph/lab
  ```

- **Linux**:
  You usually don't need to set `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST`. It defaults to
  `localhost`, which works if Memgraph is running directly on the host.

Additionally, you can specify a custom port using the `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_PORT`
environment variable. For example:

```bash
-e QUICK_CONNECT_MG_PORT=7688
```

This allows Memgraph Lab to connect using a different port if needed.


### Connection failure

If `mgconsole` says:

```bash
Connection failure: Couldn't connect to 127.0.0.1:7687!
```

To fix this issue, just replace `HOST` from the first command with
`host.docker.internal`. To find out more about networking in Docker, take a look
at [Networking features in Docker Desktop for
Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/) guide or
[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/) guide .


### Issues with the IP address

While uncommon, some users may face connectivity issues after installing
Memgraph via Docker. Instead of running on `localhost`, the Memgraph container
might be assigned a custom IP address. You can identify and use this IP address
by following these steps:

<Steps>

{<h3 className="custom-header">Find the container ID</h3>}

First, list your running Docker containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

You’ll see an output like:

```
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED
9397623cd87e    memgraph    "/usr/lib/memgraph/m…"   2 seconds ago
```

Take note of the `CONTAINER ID` for the Memgraph image — in this case, it's
`9397623cd87e.`

{<h3 className="custom-header">Get the container's IP address</h3>}

Next, retrieve the container’s internal IP address using the ID:

```bash
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e
```

This IP is the address you’ll use to connect via **Memgraph Lab** or
**mgconsole**.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Use the IP to connect</h3>}

Replace `HOST` in the following command with the IP address you just retrieved:

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform --host HOST
```

This ensures you're connecting directly to the Memgraph instance running in
Docker.

</Steps>
