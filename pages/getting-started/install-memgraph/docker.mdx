# Install Memgraph with Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a service that uses OS-level virtualization
to deliver software in packages that are called
[containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).

Memgraph uses Docker because it is:

- Flexible
- Lightweight
- Portable - you can build locally or deploy to the cloud
- Runs on all platforms - Windows, Linux and macOS
- Deploys in Kubernetes

Memgraph bundles the database along with various analytical tools into distinct
Docker images. If you're new to Memgraph or you're in a developing stage, we
recommend using the `memgraph-platform` image. It includes:
- **Memgraph** - the database that holds your data
- **[Memgraph Lab](/data-visualization)** - web interface for running queries and visualizing
  graph data
- **[mgconsole](/getting-started/cli)** - command-line interface for running queries
- **[MAGE](/advanced-algorithms)** - graph algorithms and modules library

Once you're ready to go to production you can choose to use [other Docker
images](#install-memgraph-using-other-docker-images), for example, the
`memgraph-mage` Docker image that includes the database and the algorithms, or
run the database only, using the `memgraph` image.

## Install Memgraph Platform

<Steps>

{<h3>Install Docker Desktop</h3>}

Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) by following the instructions available on their site. 

{<h3>Install and run Memgraph</h3>}

Open a terminal and use the following command:

<CodeSnippet code="docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph-platform" page="install-memgraph/docker"/>

After downloading the image, Memgraph will install and if the installation was
successful, you should see a message similar to the following:

```nocopy

```

Memgraph will start listing the logs, and don't worry about the inital errors
and warnings as at this point, they are of informative nature. 

{<h3>Connect to the instance</h3>}

You can connect to the Memgraph instance using the command-line interface
[mgconsole](/getting-started/cli) by running the following command in a new
terminal:

```terminal
docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole
```

When the mgconsole starts, you can query the database: 

```nocopy
C:\Users\Vlasta>docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole
mgconsole 1.3
Connected to 'memgraph://127.0.0.1:7687'
Type :help for shell usage
Quit the shell by typing Ctrl-D(eof) or :quit
memgraph>
```

You can also connect to Memgraph using the [Memgraph Lab web
application](/data-visualization/user-manual) available within the
`memgraph-platform` Docker image by visiting `localhost:3000`.

To start using Memgraph in your application, use one of the [client
libraries](/client-libraries) and follow their getting started guide.

</Steps>

### Running individual tools from Memgraph Platform image

You can run only the **Memgraph database instance** from the Memgraph Platform image
using the following command: 

```terminal
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-platform -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord-memgraph-only.conf
```

You can run only **mgconsole** web application from the Memgraph Platform
image using the following command in Linux:

```terminal
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

You can run only **mgconsole** web application from the Memgraph Platform
image using the following command in Windows and macOS:

```terminal
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform --host host.docker.internal
```

You can run only the **Memgraph Lab** web application from the Memgraph Platform
image using the following command: 

```terminal
docker run -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord-lab-only.conf
```

### Stop and start the instance

You can stop the instance with `docker stop memgraph`.

You can restart the instance with `docker start memgraph`

## Other available Docker images

All Memgraph Docker images are availble at [Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph). There you will find the exact Docker
image tags you can use to install Memgraph with. 

when you're developing or if you're new to Memgraph we recommend using the
`memgraph-platform` image. Once you're ready to go to production you can choose
to use the `memgraph-mage` Docker image that includes the database and the graph
library, or just run the database using the `memgraph` image.

The main repositories are: 

- `memgraph/memgraph-platform` includes Memgraph database, command-line
  interface [`mgconsole`](/getting-started/cli), [`MAGE`](/advanced-algorithms)
  graph algorithms library and [`Memgraph Lab`](/data-visualization) web interface
    - `memgraph/memgraph-platform` also includes a version of image without the
      graph algorithms library [`MAGE`](/advanced-algorithms) (look for the tag
      using only `memgraph` and `lab` keywords).
- `memgraph/memgraph-mage` includes Memgraph database, command-line interface
  [`mgconsole`](/getting-started/cli) and [`MAGE`](/advanced-algorithms) graph
  algorithms library
    - `memgraph/memgraph-mage` + cuGraph - includes Memgraph database,
  command-line interface [`mgconsole`](/getting-started/cli),
  [`MAGE`](/advanced-algorithms) graph algorithms library and [NVIDIA cuGraph
  GPU-powered](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/cugraph) graph
  algorithms
- `memgraph/memgraph` includes Memgraph database and command-line interface
  [`mgconsole`](/getting-started/cli)

## Install Memgraph using other Docker images

To install Memgraph from any image, you need to adjust the `docker run` command
in Step 2. 

`memgraph/memgraph-mage` + cuGraph have a specific installation process. 

### `memgraph/memgraph-platform` without MAGE

Install and run the `memgraph-platform` image that doesn't include
[MAGE](/advanced-algorithms) using the following command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph-platform:2.10.2-memgraph2.10.1-lab2.8.1
```

application](/data-visualization/user-manual), available for download from
[Memgraph's Download Hub](https://memgraph.com/download). 

To start using Memgraph in your application, use one of the [client
libraries](/client-libraries) and follow their getting started guide.

### `memgraph/memgraph-mage` + cuGraph

<Steps>

{<h3>Check prerequisites</h3>}

To be able to run cuGraph analytics, make sure you have compatible
infrastructure first. The exact system requirements are available at the [NVIDIA
RAPIDS site](https://docs.rapids.ai/install#requirements), and include an NVIDIA
Pascal (or better) GPU and up-to-date CUDA & NVIDIA drivers.

You will also need to install:

- Official [NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) for your operating system.
- To run on NVIDIA-powered GPUs, RAPIDS requires Docker CE v19.03+ and [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).
- Legacy Docker CE v17-18 users requie the [nvidia-docker2 package](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation-(version-2.0)).

{<h3>Install and run Memgraph</h3>}

Install and run Memgraph using the following command:

```console
docker run --rm --gpus all -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage:1.3-cugraph-22.02-cuda-11.5
```

Check the latest versions of cuGraph Docker images at [Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph), by searching the
`memgraph/memgraph-mage` repository with the `cugraph` keyword.

You can connect to the Memgraph instance using the command-line interface
[mgconsole](/getting-started/cli) by running the following command in a new
terminal:

```terminal
docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole
```

You can also connect to Memgraph instance using the [Memgraph Platform desktop
application](/data-visualization/user-manual), available for download from
[Memgraph's Download Hub](https://memgraph.com/download). 

To start using Memgraph in your application, use one of the [client
libraries](/client-libraries) and follow their getting started guide.

</Steps>

### `memgraph/memgraph`

Install and run the `memgraph` image using the following command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph
```

You can connect to the Memgraph instance using the command-line interface
[mgconsole](/getting-started/cli) by running the following command in a new
terminal:

```terminal
docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole
```

You can also connect to Memgraph instance using the [Memgraph Platform desktop
application](/data-visualization/user-manual), available for download from
[Memgraph's Download Hub](https://memgraph.com/download). 

To start using Memgraph in your application, use one of the [client
libraries](/client-libraries) and follow their getting started guide.

## Configuration options

To learn about all the configuration options, check out the [configuration
settings](/configuration/configuration-settings).

When using Docker, you can specify the configuration options in the `docker run`
command:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH="--log-level=TRACE" memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

When working with Memgraph Platform, you should pass configuration flags inside
of environment variables, while all the other Docker images use regular
configuration flags.

For example, you can start the `memgraph` image with `docker run
memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE`, but you should start the
`memgraph-platform` with `docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 -e
MEMGRAPH="--bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE" memgraph/memgraph-platform`.

## Troubleshooting

### Issues with loading Memgraph
```console
docker load -i memgraph.tar.gz
```
{<h4>Error during connect:<br/> <code>This error may indicate that the docker daemon is not running.</code></h4>}

Run the Docker Desktop application and wait for it to load fully.

{<h4>Error response from daemon:<br/> <code>open \\.\pipe\docker_engine_linux: The system cannot find the file specified.</code></h4>}

Reload the Docker Desktop application and wait for it to load fully.

{<h4>Unsupported OS Linux</h4>}

You need to download the [Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package),
and enable experimental features in Docker Desktop, under *Settings* -> *Docker
Engine*, change *experimental* to *true*.

### Issues when connecting to Memgraph

```console
docker run memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

While this command will start a Memgraph instance, not publishing the port will
cause problems when trying to connect to the database via **Memgraph Lab** or
**mgconsole**. To avoid this, you should publish the
container's port to the host using the `-p` flag and by specifying the port:

```console
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

### Issues with connecting `mgconsole` to the database

```console
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform --host HOST
```

Although unlikely, sometimes there are issues with connecting **mgconsole** to
the Docker Container’s IP address because it is running on a custom IP rather
than `localhost`. This problem is most often accompanied with the following
error:

```console
Connection failure: Couldn't connect to 127.0.0.1:7687!
```

To fix this issue, just replace `HOST` from the first command with
`host.docker.internal`. To find out more about networking in Docker, take a look
at [Networking features in Docker Desktop for
Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/) guide or
[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/) guide .

### Issues with the IP address

Although unlikely, some users might experience minor difficulties after the
Docker installation. Instead of running on `localhost`, a Docker container for
Memgraph may be running on a custom IP address. Fortunately, that IP address can
be found as follows:

**1.** Determine the ID of the Memgraph Container by issuing the
command `docker ps`. The user should get an output similar to the following:

```console
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED
9397623cd87e    memgraph    "/usr/lib/memgraph/m…"   2 seconds ago
```

At this point, it is important to remember the container ID of the Memgraph
Image. In our case, that is `9397623cd87e`.

**2.** Use the this ID to retrieve the IP address of the Container:

```console
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e
```

The command above will yield the IP address that should be used when connecting
to Memgraph via **Memgraph Lab** or **mgconsole**. Just replace
`HOST` from the following command with the appropriate IP address:

```console
docker run -it --entrypoint=mgconsole memgraph/memgraph-platform --host HOST
```
