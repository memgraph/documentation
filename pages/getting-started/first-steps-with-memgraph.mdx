# First steps with Memgraph

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Memgraph and run your first query. 

<Steps>

### Prerequisites 

Memgraph Platform can be installed only with **Docker**. Instructions on how to
install Docker can be found on the [official Docker
website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).


### Install Memgraph Platform

First, you need to download and install Memgraph Platform. Open a terminal on
your computer and depending you your OS run the following command:

**For Linux and macOS:**

<CodeSnippet code="curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh" page="first-steps-with-memgraph"/>

**For Windows:**

<CodeSnippet code="iwr https://windows.memgraph.com | iex" page="first-steps-with-memgraph"/>

<Callout type="info">

If you can not run the command `curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh` you can use the the insructions provided in our [Docker compose documentation](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker-compose)

</Callout>

Once the installation is done, you will see a message similar to this one:

```
$ curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  2222    0  2222    0     0   5566      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  5582
Checking for requirements on this machine:
curl ✔
docker ✔
docker compose ✔
grep ✔
mkdir ✔
pwd ✔

Downloading docker compose file to: /c/Users/Kruno/memgraph-platform/docker-compose.yml
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   424  100   424    0     0   1570      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  1576

Spinning up memgraph lab and memgraph with mage using docker compose file from: /c/Users/Kruno/memgraph-platform/docker-compose.yml
 Container memgraph-mage  Created

memgraph-mage  | [2024-02-13 14:55:33.176] [warning] storage_parallel_index_recovery flag is deprecated. Check storage_mode_parallel_schema_recovery for more details.
memgraph-mage  | You are running Memgraph v2.14.0
memgraph-mage  | To get started with Memgraph, visit https://memgr.ph/start
memgraph-lab   | [2024-02-13 14:55:34.664] INFO: [lab] Lab is running at http://localhost:3000 in docker mode
```

That means that you have installed Memgraph Platform and that you have Memgraph
up and running.



### Connect to Memgraph Lab

Since you've installed and started Memgraph using the Memgraph Platform,
Memgraph Lab is already running. Open your web browser and go to
[`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). When the Memgraph Lab loads, click
**Connect now**.

That's it! You can see the Memgraph Lab Dashboard, so you are ready to head over
to the next step.

### Migrate your data

As a new user, you'll want to populate your fresh Memgraph installation with
data. The method you choose will largely depend on the format of your data.
Memgraph supports imports from various formats, such as CSV, JSON and using
queries listed in a CYPHERL file. For detailed instructions on migrating your
data, refer to the [data migration documentation](/data-migration).

If you're just getting started and want a quick setup, Memgraph offers a range
of pre-made datasets ideal for testing and learning. We have prepared more than
20 datasets you can use for testing and learning. If you wish to use a demo
dataset, go to **Datasets** section, chose a dataset and **Load dataset**.

![](/pages/getting-started/first-steps/memgraph-lab-datasets.png)

A warning will appear, notifying you that importing a new dataset will overwrite
the current data in the database. As a new user, you won't have existing data,
but it's crucial to note this for future imports. Confirm the action by clicking
**Confirm**.

Once the import completes, click the **X** to close the dialog.

### Run a query

Now that the data is imported it is time to run your first Cypher query. Go to
the  **Query Execution** section in the sidebar, and then copy-and-paste the
following code into the **Cypher editor**.

```cypher

MATCH (n)-[r]-(m)
RETURN n, r, m;

```

Click **Run query** to run the above query that will return all the nodes and
relationships in the database and see the result in the **Graph results** tab.

This an example using one of the preloaded datasets:

![](/pages/getting-started/first-steps/memgraph-lab-first-cypher-query.png)

If you're transitioning from Neo4j to Memgraph, adapting your existing Cypher
queries is essential. While both platforms use the Cypher query language, there
might be platform-specific features that require adjustments. To assist you, we
provide a [comprehensive documentation](/querying) to help you adapt and
optimize your queries for Memgraph.

### Build a new application

If you're developing a new application and want to utilize Cypher queries across
different programming languages, check out our guide on interfacing with
Memgraph through various [client libraries](/client-libraries). Memgraph
supports a wide array of programming languages including Java, Python, Rust, and
Node.js, among others. Each client library is designed to interface with
Memgraph and is optimized for graph database communication.

### Running advanced algorithms

Memgraph offers a range of procedures tailored to address specific graph
problems. Built-in algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Weighted shortest path, and All
shortest paths can be executed using their specific clauses. 

Memgraph comes with expanded set of algorithms called [Memgraph Advanced Graph
Extensions (MAGE)](/advanced-algorithms) library. MAGE is an open-source
repository housing graph algorithms, both by the Memgraph team and the
community. These are presented as query modules. 

![](/pages/getting-started/first-steps/query-modules.png)

One of the advanced algorithms at your disposal is the PageRank algorithm. You
can run it with the folowing code:

```cypher

CALL pagerank.get()
YIELD node, rank;

```
