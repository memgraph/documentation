# First steps with Memgraph

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Memgraph Platform, connect to it
using Memgraph Lab, run your first query and style your graph. You will see that
using Memgraph is not hard at all! 

This tutorial is also available as a video on Memgraph's YouTube channel:

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites 

Memgraph Platform can be installed only with **Docker**. Instructions on how to
install Docker can be found on the [official Docker
website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<Steps>
### Install Memgraph Platform

First, you need to download and install Memgraph Platform. All you need to do is
to open a terminal on your computer and run the following command:

```bash
docker run --name memgraph -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

Once the installation is done, you will see a message similar to this one:

```nocopy

2023-09-11 09:30:31,692 INFO Included extra file "/etc/supervisor/programs/lab.conf" during parsing
2023-09-11 09:30:31,692 INFO Included extra file "/etc/supervisor/programs/memgraph.conf" during parsing
2023-09-11 09:30:31,692 INFO Set uid to user 0 succeeded

2023-09-11 09:30:32,697 INFO spawned: 'memgraph' with pid 7
2023-09-11 09:30:32,698 INFO spawned: 'lab' with pid 8
You are running Memgraph v2.10.1
To get started with Memgraph, visit https://memgr.ph/start

```

That means that you have installed Memgraph Platform and that you have Memgraph
up and running. Kudos!

### Connect to Memgraph Lab

Since you installed and started the Memgraph Platform, then the Memgraph Lab is
already running, so open your web browser and go to
[`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). When the Memgraph Lab loads, click
**Connect now**.

That's it! You can see the Memgraph Lab Dashboard, so you are ready to head over
to the next step.

### Migrating your data

As a new user, you'll want to populate your fresh Memgraph installation with
data. The method you choose will largely depend on the format of your data.
Memgraph supports imports from various formats and systems. For detailed
instructions on migrating your data, refer to our [data migration documentation](/data-migration).

<Callout type="info">

If you're just getting started and want a quick setup, Memgraph offers
a range of pre-made datasets ideal for testing and learning. We have prepared
more than 20 datasets that you can use for testing and learning. If you wish to use a demo dataset:

1. In the sidebar, click **Datasets**.
2. Navigate to **Capital cities and borders** and click **Load Dataset**.

A warning will appear, notifying you that importing a new dataset will overwrite
the current data in the database. As a new user, you won't have existing data,
but it's crucial to note this for future imports. Confirm the action by clicking
**Confirm**.


3. Once the import completes, click the **X** to close the dialog.

4. Run your query

Now that the data is imported it is time to run your first Cypher query. You
will write a query that that displays all of the cities and all of the
connections. 

Click the **Query Execution** in the sidebar, and then copy-and-paste the
following code into the **Cypher Editor**.

```cypher

MATCH (n)-[r]-(m)
RETURN n, r, m;

```

Click **Run query** to run the above query and see the result in the **Graph
results** tab.

</Callout>


</Steps>

## Transitioning from Neo4j to Memgraph

If you're transitioning from Neo4j to Memgraph, adapting your existing Cypher
queries is essential. While both platforms use the Cypher query language, there
might be platform-specific features that require adjustments. To assist you, we
provide a [comprehensive documentation](/querying) to help you adapt and
optimize your queries for Memgraph.

## Building a new application

If you're developing a new application and want to utilize Cypher queries across
different programming languages, check out our guide on interfacing with
Memgraph through various [client libraries](/client-libraries). Memgraph
supports a wide array of programming languages including Java, Python, Rust, and
Node.js, among others. Each client library is designed to interface with
Memgraph and is optimized for graph database communication.
