## Work with Docker

If you are new to Docker, this guide will help you get a grasp of Docker and
make it easier to accomplish tasks within Memgraph. After installing Docker, all
commands are run from the command-line tool of your preference.

### Download the Memgraph Docker image

Images are downloaded using the `docker pull` command followed by the name of
the Docker image. We encourage you to use Memgraph Platform as it includes
everything you might need while making the best of Memgraph.

To download the latest Memgraph Platform image, run:

```
docker pull memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

All Memgraph Docker images are availble at [Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph). There you will find exact Docker image
tags you can downalod and use to install Memgraph with. 

### Architecture of Docker container running Memgraph

The picture below shows the architecture of the Memgraph Docker ecosystem.

![](/pages/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker/docker-architecture.png)

### Run a Memgraph Docker image

All images are started using the `docker run` command followed by various flags,
environment variables and configuration options.

The most common flags used while running Memgraph images are:

- publish ports: `-p 3000:3000`
- container name: `--name memgraph`
- set up configuration using environment variables in the case of the
  `memgraph-platform` image, or configuration flags using the `memgraph` or
  `memgraph-mage` image

A `docker run` command can look like this:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 [-p host_port:container_port] [--name container_name] [configuration] memgraph/image_name
```

#### Publish ports

Ports are published in order to allow services outside the container to be able
to connect to the container. When publishing ports, you need to define two ports
separated by a colon. The left side port stands for the **host port** and the
right side port is the **container port**.

The most common ports published while running Memgraph are:

- `-p 7687:7687` - connection to the database instance (the Bolt protocol uses
  this port by default)
- `-p 3000:3000` - connection to the Memgraph Lab application when running
  Memgraph Platform
- `-p 7444:7444` - connection to fetch log files from Memgraph Lab (only in
  version 2.0 and newer)

For example, if you are running two instances using the `memgraph-platform`
image and you want to connect to both instances using the Memgraph Lab
in-browser application. You would run the first instance with:

```
docker run -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

Because port `3000` is now taken, you need to change the left side
port (host ports):

```
docker run -p 7444:7444 -p 3001:3000 memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

To connect to the first instance, you should open Memgraph Lab in your browser
at `localhost:3000`, but the second instance is reachable at `localhost:3001`.

#### Container name

Upon creation, each container gets an ID. You can find out the container ID by
running the `docker ps` command, but you can also name the container using the
`--name` flag. Defining a name can be a handy way to add meaning to a container.
If you specify a name, you can use it when referencing the container within a
Docker network.

#### Set up the configuration

If you want a certain configuration setting to be applied during a single run,
you need to pass the configuration option within the `docker run` command
instead of changing the configuration file.

If you are working with the `memgraph-platform` image, you should pass
configuration options with environment variables.

For example, if you want to limit memory usage for the whole instance to 50 MiB
and set the log level to `TRACE`, pass the configuration like this:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 -p 7444:7444 -e MEMGRAPH="--memory-limit=50 --log-level=TRACE" memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

When you are working with `memgraph` or `memgraph-mage` images, you should pass
configuration options as arguments.

For example, if you want to limit memory usage for the whole instance to 50 MiB
and set the log level to `TRACE`, pass the configuration argument like this:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph --memory-limit=50 --log-level=TRACE
```

#### Specify volumes

Specifying a volume syncs the specified directory inside the Docker container as
a local directory and serves for durability. The `-v` flag is followed by the
name of the local directory separated from the path of the volume in the
container by a semicolon:

```
-v volume_name:volume_path
```

Named volumes handle data permissions so there shouldn't be any issue with data
permissions. 

Useful volumes you can specify while running Memgraph are:

- `-v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph` - directory containing data, enables data
  persistency
- `-v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph` - directory containing log files
- `-v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph` - directory containing the configuration file

The exact location of the local directories depends on your specific setup.

The configuration file can usually be found at
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mg_etc/_data/memgraph.conf` but you can also copy the
file from the Docker container, modify it and copy it back into the container.

The logs will be saved to the `mg_log` volume, and the directories can usually be
found in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`, but you can also view them in the Memgraph
Lab 2.0 (or newer) by publishing the port `7444`.

#### Specify bind mounts

Bind mounts are local directories or files that can be modified by other
processes other than Docker. Any changes made to these directories or files
locally will be reflected inside the Docker container and vice-versa. Also, a
bind mount will overwrite the content of the Docker container.

For example, if I have a `Data` directory on my `C:` disk, and I want to access
it from inside the container at `/usr/lib/memgraph/data`, I would run Docker
with the following `-v` flag.

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000  -v "C:/data":/usr/lib/memgraph/data memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

You can use bind mounts to transfer durability files such as snapshot or WAL
files inside the container to restore data, or CSV files you will use to import
data with `CSV LOAD` clause. 

Bind mounts do not handle data permissions which could cause issues with
permissions. 

### Stop container

Database instances are stopped by stopping the Docker container with the command
`docker stop`. To stop a container you need [to know the container's
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or [name](#container-name).

You can list all the containers you want to stop in one `docker stop` command:

```
docker stop CONTAINER1_ID CONTAINER2_ID CONTAINER3_NAME
```

### Start container

If you want to start a stopped container, list them using the following command: 

```
docker ps -a
```

Then start the container with: 
```
docker start <CONTAINER_ID> 
```

or 

```
docker start <CONTAINER_NAME> 
```

### Retrieve a Docker container ID

Run the following command:

```
docker ps
```

You should get an output similar to this:

```console
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                                                    NAMES
45fa0f86f826   memgraph/memgraph-platform   "/bin/sh -c '/usr/bi…"   21 hours ago   Up 21 hours   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7444->7444/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7687->7687/tcp   admiring_almeida
```

You can shorten this ID to 4 letters if the ID remains unique, for example,
`45fa`.

### Retrieve a Docker container IP address

To retrieve the Docker container IP address, first, you need [to retrieve its
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or use its [name](#container-name).

Then run the following command if the container ID is `9397623cd87e`.

```console
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e
```

### Browse files inside a Docker container

To browse files inside a Docker container, first, you need [to retrieve its
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or use its [name](#container-name).

Then run the following command if the container ID is `9397623cd87e`:

```
docker exec -it 9397623cd87e bash
```

To navigate through the container, use the following commands:

- `ls` - list all the directories and files
- `cd <directory>` - enter a directory
- `cd ..` - leave the directory
- `cat <file>` - list the content of a file

You don't have to write file and directory names in full, once you write enough
letters to have a unique string, press the `<TAB>` key.

### Copy files from and to a Docker container

To copy files from and to the Docker container, first, you need [to retrieve its
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or use its [name](#container-name).

1. Place yourself in the local directory where you want to copy the file.

2. Copy the file from the container to your current directory with the command:

  ```
  docker cp <CONTAINER ID>:<path_in_container> <local_file_name>
  ```

  Be sure to replace the `<CONTAINER ID>` parameter.

  The example below will copy the configuration file to the user's Desktop:

  ```
  C:\Users\Vlasta\Desktop>docker cp bb3de2634afe:/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf memgraph.conf
  ```

3. Copy the file from your current directory to the container with the command:

  ```
  docker cp  <local_file_name> <CONTAINER ID>:<path_in_container>
  ```

  Be sure to replace the `<CONTAINER ID>` parameter.

  The example below will replace the configuration file with the one from the
  user's Desktop:

  ```
  C:\Users\Vlasta\Desktop>docker cp memgraph.conf bb3de2634afe:/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf
  ```
