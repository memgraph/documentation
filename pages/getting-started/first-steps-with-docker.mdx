</Steps>

### MacOS

Check the prerequisites then follow the installation process. 

#### Prerequisites 

- Docker supports Docker Desktop on the most recent versions of macOS. That is,
  the current release of macOS and the previous two releases. As new major
  versions of macOS are made generally available, Docker stops supporting the
  oldest version and supports the newest version of macOS (in addition to the
  previous two releases).
- At least 4 GB of RAM.

#### Installation process

<Steps>

{<h3 className="custom-header">Download Docker Desktop installer</h3>}

Navigate to the [Docker Desktop web

## Verifying Docker Installation

To ensure that Docker has been successfully installed and is running on your system, follow the steps below:

<Steps>
{<h3 className="custom-header">Open the Command Line or Terminal</h3>}

- **Windows**: Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
- **Mac**: Press `Command + Space`, type `terminal`, and hit Enter.
- **Linux**: Depending on the distribution, you can use shortcuts like `Ctrl + Alt + T` or access the terminal from the application menu.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Verify Docker Version</h3>}

Run the following command:

```
docker --version
```

It should display the version of Docker installed on your machine. For example:

```
Docker version 24.0.6, build ed223bc
```

{<h3 className="custom-header">Check Docker Details</h3>}

For more detailed information about the Docker installation, you can use:

```
docker info
```

This command provides a comprehensive overview of your Docker setup, including the number of containers running, paused, and stopped, as well as other system information.

{<h3 className="custom-header">Ensure Docker Daemon is Running</h3>}

To check that the Docker daemon (background service) is running, execute:

```
docker system info
```

If Docker is running correctly, this command will return system-wide information. If not, you may receive an error indicating that Docker is not running.

</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors or if Docker does not seem to be running:

- Ensure that the Docker Desktop application (for Mac and Windows) is running.
- On Linux, you might need to start the Docker service manually using a command like `sudo service docker start` or `sudo systemctl start docker`, depending on your Linux distribution.

## Managing Docker Service on Windows using PowerShell

On Windows, Docker typically runs as a service via Docker Desktop. While Docker
Desktop provides a user-friendly interface for managing Docker, there are
instances where you might want to control the Docker service directly from the
command line using PowerShell.

To open PowerShell as an administrator, right-click the Start button and select
"Terminal (Admin)" or search for "PowerShell" in the start menu, right-click
"Windows PowerShell", and select "Run as administrator".

### Check the Status of the Docker Service

To verify the status of the Docker service, whether it's running or stopped, use:

```powershell
Get-Service com.docker.service
```

This command will display the status of the Docker service.

### Start the Docker Service

If Docker isn't running and you want to start it, use the following command:

```powershell
net start com.docker.service
```

You should receive a message indicating that the Docker service has started successfully.

### Stop the Docker Service

To stop the Docker service, use the following command:

```powershell
net stop com.docker.service
```

You should receive a message indicating that the Docker service has stopped.


## Work with Docker

If you are new to Docker, this guide will help you get a grasp of Docker and
make it easier to accomplish tasks within Memgraph. After installing Docker, all
commands are run from the command-line tool of your preference.

### Download the Memgraph Docker image

You can think about downloading Memgraph Docker images as obtaining a blueprint
for Memgraph, complete with all its core features. This image is your starting
point. From it, you can launch a container, which acts as a live instance of
Memgraph. All your interactions, queries, and transactions with Memgraph occur
within this container. This ensures a consistent and isolated setting for all
your database tasks. From a single image, you can spawn multiple containers.
Each container functions as a distinct Memgraph instance.

Images are downloaded using the `docker pull` command followed by the name of
the Docker image. All Memgraph Docker images are available at [Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph). There you will find exact Docker image
tags you can download and use to install Memgraph with. 

### Run a Memgraph Docker image

All images are started using the `docker run` command followed by various flags,
environment variables and configuration options.

The most common flags used while running Memgraph images are:

- publish ports: `-p 3000:3000`
- container name: `--name memgraph`
- set up configuration using configuration flags using the `memgraph` or
  `memgraph-mage` image

A `docker run` command can look like this:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 [-p host_port:container_port] [--name container_name] [configuration] memgraph/image_name
```

#### Publish ports

Ports are published in order to allow services outside the container to be able
to connect to the container. When publishing ports, you need to define two ports
separated by a colon. The left side port stands for the **host port** and the
right side port is the **container port**.

The most common ports published while running Memgraph are:

- `-p 7687:7687` - connection to the database instance (the Bolt protocol uses
  this port by default)
- `-p 7444:7444` - connection to fetch log files from Memgraph Lab (only in
  version 2.0 and newer)

For example, if you are running two instances using the `memgraph-mage`
image and you would run the first instance with:

<CodeSnippet code="docker run -p 7444:7444 -p 7687:7687  memgraph/memgraph-mage" page="getting-started/first-steps-with-docker" os="docker"/>

Because ports `7444` and `7687`are now taken, you need to change the left side
ports (host ports):

<CodeSnippet code="docker run -p 7445:7444 -p 7688:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage" page="getting-started/first-steps-with-docker" os="docker"/>


#### Container name

Upon creation, each container gets an ID. You can find out the container ID by
running the `docker ps` command, but you can also name the container using the
`--name` flag. Defining a name can be a handy way to add meaning to a container.
If you specify a name, you can use it when referencing the container within a
Docker network.

#### Set up the configuration

If you want a certain [configuration
setting](/database-management/configuration) to be applied during a single
run, you need to pass the configuration option within the `docker run` command
instead of changing the configuration file.

When you are working with `memgraph` or `memgraph-mage` images, you should pass
configuration options as arguments.

For example, if you want to limit memory usage for the whole instance to 50 MiB
and set the log level to `TRACE`, pass the configuration argument like this:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph --memory-limit=50 --log-level=TRACE
```

#### Specify volumes

Specifying a volume syncs the specified directory inside the Docker container as
a local directory. The `-v` flag is followed by the name of the local directory
separated from the path of the volume in the container by a semicolon:

```
-v volume_name:volume_path
```

Named volumes handle data permissions so there shouldn't be any issue with data
permissions. 

Useful volumes you can specify while running Memgraph are:

- `-v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph` - directory containing data, enables data
  persistency
- `-v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph` - directory containing log files
- `-v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph` - directory containing the configuration file

The exact location of the local directories depends on your specific setup.

The configuration file can usually be found at
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/mg_etc/_data/memgraph.conf` but you can also copy the
file from the Docker container, modify it and copy it back into the container.

The logs will be saved to the `mg_log` volume, and the directories can usually be
found in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`, but you can also view them in the Memgraph
Lab 2.0 (or newer) by publishing the port `7444`.

#### Specify bind mounts

Bind mounts are local directories or files that can be modified by other
processes other than Docker. Any changes made to these directories or files
locally will be reflected inside the Docker container and vice-versa. Also, a
bind mount will overwrite the content of the Docker container.

For example, if I have a `Data` directory on my `C:` disk, and I want to access
it from inside the container at `/usr/lib/memgraph/data`, I would run Docker
with the following `-v` flag.

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v "C:/data":/usr/lib/memgraph/data memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

You can use bind mounts to transfer durability files such as snapshot or WAL
files inside the container to restore data, or CSV files you will use to import
data with `CSV LOAD` clause. 

Bind mounts do not handle data permissions which could cause issues with
permissions. 

### Stop container

<Callout type="info">
Stopping the container isn't the same thing as [deleting it](#delete-container).
</Callout>

Database instances are stopped by stopping the Docker container with the command
`docker stop`. To stop a container you need [to know the container's
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or [name](#container-name).

You can list all the containers you want to stop in one `docker stop` command:

```
docker stop CONTAINER1_ID CONTAINER2_ID CONTAINER3_NAME
```

### Start container

If you want to start a stopped container, list them using the following command: 

```
docker ps -a
```

Then start the container with: 
```
docker start <CONTAINER_ID> 
```

or 

```
docker start <CONTAINER_NAME> 
```

### Delete container

<Callout type="warning">
Deleting a container will permanently remove it from your system. Ensure you have backed up any important data before proceeding.
</Callout>

To remove a Docker container, you first need to ensure that it's stopped. Once
it's stopped, you can use the `docker rm` command. Like stopping a container,
you'll need [to know the container's ID](#retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or
[name](#container-name) to delete it.

Here's how you can delete a single container:

```
docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>
```

or 

```
docker rm <CONTAINER_NAME>
```

If you want to remove multiple containers in one go, simply list them all in the `docker rm` command:

```
docker rm CONTAINER1_ID CONTAINER2_ID CONTAINER3_NAME
```

### Retrieve a Docker container ID

Run the following command:

```
docker ps
```

You should get an output similar to this:

```console
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                            NAMES
d44f049fef87   memgraph/memgraph-mage   "/usr/lib/memgraph/m…"   8 seconds ago   Up 6 seconds   0.0.0.0:7444->7444/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7687->7687/tcp   musing_pasteur
```

You can shorten this ID to 4 letters if the ID remains unique, for example,
`45fa`.

### Retrieve a Docker container IP address

To retrieve the Docker container IP address, first, you need [to retrieve its
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or use its [name](#container-name).

Then run the following command if the container ID is `9397623cd87e`.

```console
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' 9397623cd87e
```

### Browse files inside a Docker container

To browse files inside a Docker container, first, you need [to retrieve its
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or use its [name](#container-name).

Then run the following command if the container ID is `9397623cd87e`:

```
docker exec -it 9397623cd87e bash
```

To navigate through the container, use the following commands:

- `ls` - list all the directories and files
- `cd <directory>` - enter a directory
- `cd ..` - leave the directory
- `cat <file>` - list the content of a file

You don't have to write file and directory names in full, once you write enough
letters to have a unique string, press the `<TAB>` key.

### Copy files from and to a Docker container

To copy files from and to the Docker container, first, you need [to retrieve its
ID](#how-to-retrieve-a-docker-container-id) or use its [name](#container-name).

First, place yourself in the local directory where you want to copy the file.

To copy the file from the container to your current directory use the following command:


  ```
  docker cp <CONTAINER ID>:<path_in_container> <local_file_name>
  ```

  Be sure to replace the `<CONTAINER ID>` parameter.

  The example below will copy the configuration file to the user's Desktop:

  ```
  C:\Users\Vlasta\Desktop>docker cp bb3de2634afe:/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf memgraph.conf
  ```

To copy the file from your current directory to the container use the following command:

  ```
  docker cp  <local_file_name> <CONTAINER ID>:<path_in_container>
  ```

  Be sure to replace the `<CONTAINER ID>` parameter.

  The example below will replace the configuration file with the one from the
  user's Desktop:

  ```
  C:\Users\Vlasta\Desktop>docker cp memgraph.conf bb3de2634afe:/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf
  ```

## Difference Between `docker run` and `docker start`

The commands `docker run` and `docker start` may seem similar, but they are
quite different. Each command serves a specific purpose:

- **`docker run`**: This command is used for creating and launching a new
  container from a Docker image. When executing `docker run`, Docker first
  searches for the specified image in the local repository. If the image is not
  found locally, Docker fetches it from Docker Hub. Once the image is obtained,
  Docker creates a new container from this image and initiates it. This command
  is used for setting up a new container instance with various configurations.

- **`docker start`**: This command is used for restarting an
  existing, previously stopped container. Containers may be stopped using the
  `docker stop` command or may exit naturally. When a container is stopped, its
  state is preserved, allowing `docker start` to reactivate the container with
  all its prior settings intact. This command is used for reactivating a
  container without repeating the initial setup and initialization process
  required by `docker run`. It's important to note that `docker start` is
  applicable only to containers that have already been created and stopped; it
  cannot be used to create a new container.

## Containers and data persistence

When you're working with Docker, it's essential to understand how data is
handled in containers. 

**Your data is safe**: Even if you [stop a container](#stop-container) using the `docker stop`
command or if it crashes unexpectedly, the data and changes inside that
container are retained. So, when you restart the stopped container, you'll find
everything just as you left it.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- **Deleting a container**: If you deliberately delete a container using
  commands like `docker rm`, the changes and data within that container will be
  lost unless you've saved them in Docker volumes or bind mounts.
  
- **Using volumes**: To ensure long-term data safety and for scenarios where you
  might delete containers but want to retain their data, Docker provides a
  feature called
  [volumes](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker#specify-volumes). Volumes
  allow you to store data outside the container, ensuring it remains safe and
  accessible even if the container is removed.

In short, while working with containers, always remember: stopping isn't
deleting. Your data stays intact when a container is merely stopped. If you're
planning to remove containers but wish to keep the data, ensure you've set up
Docker volumes **prior to running the container**.
