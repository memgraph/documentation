#  Fundamentals

Fundamentals are like the building blocks that lay the foundation for you to
grasp and tinker with different parts of Memgraph. These essential principles
cover stuff like data integrity rules, data types, graph modeling, indexes, and
more.

## [Constraints](/fundamentals/constraints)

Constraints define rules and conditions that ensure the integrity and validity
of data stored in a database, preventing inconsistent or incorrect entries.

## [Data types](/fundamentals/data-types)

Data types form the foundational architecture upon which the information within
a database is built and processed. These categories categorize and define the
nature of values stored within variables, fields, and structures. 

## [Graph modeling](/fundamentals/graph-modeling)

Graph modeling helps you map out nodes and relationships and how everything is
linked together to enable analysis of complex interconnected information.

## [Indexes](/fundamentals/indexes)

Indexes optimize database performance by organizing and providing quick access
to data, significantly reducing the time required for querying large datasets.

## [Storage memory usage](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage)

Efficient storage is like packing a suitcase â€“ you want to fit in as much as you
can without overloading. Storage memory usage is about smartly managing how your
data takes up space.

## [Telemetry](/fundamentals/telemetry)

Telemetry is an automated process that collects data at a remote point, and it
is used for the sole purpose of improving the product by focusing on areas that
we believe are important to you.

## [Transactions](/fundamentals/transactions)

All Cypher queries are run within transactions. Check how to create explicit
transactions to run multiple queries within one transaction, manage running
transactions as well as isolation levels available in Memgraph.

## [Triggers](/fundamentals/triggers)

Triggers are automated reactions for your database. They activate when specific
events occur, saving you the effort of constantly monitoring everything.
