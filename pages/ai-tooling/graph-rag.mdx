# GraphRAG with Memgraph


LLMs have the knowledge they were trained on. By building a RAG, you're
expanding that knowledge with your data. It is important to understand how to
**structure and model** the data and how to **find and extract relevant
information** for LLM to provide more accurate responses personalized to your
specific data.

**GraphRAG is a RAG system that combines the strengths of knowledge graphs and
LLMs**. Knowledge graphs are a structured representation of information where
entities and their relationships are organized to enable reasoning and insights.

Here are the main strengths of graph in a RAG system:
- **Relational context** - Knowledge graph structure holds the information about
  semantics.
- **Improved retrieval accuracy** - Having retrieval strategies specific to
  graphs, such as community detection and impact analytics.
- **Multi-hop reasoning** - Ability to traverse through data neighborhoods.
- **Efficient information navigation** - Scanning subgraphs instead of full
  datasets.
- **Dynamically evolving knowledge** - Updating graph in real time.

**Graph structure is a prerequisite for GraphRAG, and a graph database is even
better**. A GraphRAG application running in production needs **scalability**,
**real-time performance**, **incremental updates** and **persistence**. Having a
graph database as a part of the GraphRAG is especially useful if other
application parts also rely on the graph database.


## Key Memgraph features

Memgraph is a graph database that stores your knowledge graph, and it ensures
[durability](/fundamentals/data-durability) of stored data for backup and
recovery. Refer to our [data modeling](/data-modeling) and
[knowledge graph modeling](/data-modeling/knowledge-graph) guide for tips and tricks on how to model your
knowledge.

With Memgraph as an in-memory graph database, you can quickly traverse through
your graph with [deep path traversals](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal)
and not worry about latency. 

You can [ingest streaming data](/data-streams) into Memgraph with Kafka,
Redpanda or Pulsar which you can then query with (dynamic) MAGE algorithms or
your custom procedures. That allows you to have a growing knowledge graph that's
being updated on-the-fly. 

Here are the most useful features in Memgraph to build a GraphRAG:

- [Deep-path traversals](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal)
- [Vector search](/querying/vector-search) (experimental) - Usually used in the first step of finding and extracting
  relevant information (pivot search)
- [Leiden community
  detection](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/leiden_community_detection):
  Proven to be a better and faster version of Louvain community detection,
  guaranteeing well-connected communities. It is usually used in the second step
  of finding and extracting relevant information (relevance expansion).
- [Louvain community
  detection](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/community_detection) 
- [Dynamic community
  detection](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/community_detection_online)
- [PageRank](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/pagerank)
- [Dynamic PageRank](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/pagerank_online)
- [Text search](/querying/text-search)
- [Run-time schema tracking](/querying/schema#run-time-schema-tracking)


Here is how those features fit into the GraphRAG architecture:

## Tools 

[GraphChat](/data-visualization/user-manual/graphchat) is a Memgraph Lab feature
that allows users to extract insights from a graph database by asking questions
in plain English. It incorporates elements of GraphRAG. This two-phase
Generative AI app first generates Cypher queries from the text and then
summarizes the query results in the final response.
