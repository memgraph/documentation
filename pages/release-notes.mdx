# Release notes

Check out latest updates and enhancements to Memgraph's products. Discover
what's new and understand the pivotal shifts that might affect your experience.
Dive in to detailed listings of each version's changes, ensuring you stay
informed and prepared.

## Important changes

New releases might affect your existing code, queries or configuration.
Ensure they're updated to align with the latest updates and changes.

<Callout type="warning">

The configuration flag `storage-recover-on-startup` has been deprecated and
replaced with `data_recovery_on_startup`to support multi-tenancy. The
`storage-recover-on-startup` can still be used but it will be removed at some
point (don't worry, we will let you know when).

</Callout>

### Upgrading to Memgraph v2.13.0


<Callout type="warning"> 

Existence and unique [constraints](/fundamentals/constraints) can now also be
recovered in parallel, just like [indexes](/fundamentals/indexes). That is why
the `storage-parallel-index-recovery` configuration flag has been deprecated,
and now you can enable this behavior using the
[`storage-parallel-schema-recovery`
configuration](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage) flag.

</Callout>

### Upgrading to Memgraph v2.12.1

<Callout type="warning">

Cached query plans are no longer saved during the time interval defined by the
`--query-plan-cache-ttl`, rather they are cached by count.

This means that you need to replace any custom setting of the
`--query-plan-cache-ttl` with the `--query-plan-cache-max-size` [configuration
flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#query). By deafult, the maximum
number of cached query plans is
1000.

This change has been made to reduce the memory usage of queries with `MERGE`
queries and variables.

</Callout>

### Upgrading to Memgraph v2.12.0

<Callout type="warning">

The [`SHOW STORAGE INFO;`](/configuration/server-stats) query now returns memory
allocations in B, KiB, MiB, GiB or TiB, rather than just B so if any of your
code depends on this information be sure to make the appropriate adjustments.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">

Snapshot and WAL files versions have been updated. Snapshot and WAL files created
with Memgraph v2.12.0 and higher won't be usable in previous versions of
Memgraph (v2.11.1 and lower).

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">

You no longer need the MAGE library to run `schema` procedures or
`convert.str2object()` function.

</Callout>

### Upgrading to Memgraph v2.11.0

<Callout type="warning">

`Node Properties()` and `Relationship
Properties()` getter from the [C++ API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api)
changed return type from `std::map` to `std::unordered_map` to speed up
execution time. Check your C++ query modules for possible code changes.

</Callout>

### Upgrading to MAGE v1.11.1

<Callout type="warning">

Some of the input and output parameter names of
[collections](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/collections),
[create](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/create),
[label](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/label),
[map](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/map),
[refactor](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor) and
[schema](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/schema) query modules have
been changed to align with Memgraph's GraphQL mappings so check if you need to
change the parameters in your queries.

Also, some procedures are now functions. Functions can be called inline, while
procedures are called using the `CALL` clause. Check the documentation for each
query module for usage examples.

</Callout>

## MAGE v.1.13.0 - Dec 8 2023

- The [`regexGroups`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/text#regexgroups)
  procedure of the `text` query module enables the search for regex
  subexpression in a text using the [C++
  regex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex) library. and the
  [`format()`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/text#format) procedure
  enables formatting string using the [fmt
  library](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt).
  [#420](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/420)
  [#423](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/423)
- Deleted return values for query procedures and functions ran in [the in-memory
  analytical storage mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#implications) are
  now properly handled. [#400](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/400)

## Memgraph v2.13.0 - Dec 8, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- Now you can check information about node labels and relationship types by
  running the [schema-related queries](/querying/schema#schema-related-queries)
  `SHOW NODE_LABELS INFO;` and `SHOW EDGE_TYPES INFO;`.
  [#1466](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1466)
- Existence and unique [constraints](/fundamentals/constraints) can now also be
  recovered in parallel, just like [indexes](/fundamentals/indexes). To enable
  this behaviour, set the [`storage-parallel-schema-recovery`
  configuration](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage) flag to `true`.
  As the new configuration flag includes the constraints, the
  `storage-parallel-index-recovery` has been deprecated.
  [#1545](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1545)
- Now you can assert indexes and constraints using the
  [`schema.assert()`](/querying/schema#schema-assert) procedure.
  [#1485](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1485)
- Improved the logic when checking [the `exist()`
  statements](/querying/functions#pattern-functions) within [the `WHERE`
  clause](/querying/clauses/where#17-filter-with-pattern-expressions) in order
  to improve performance.
  [#1539](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1539)
- The filter information message of `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` queries displays the
  exact filtering in the filter expression.
  [#1481](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1481)
- When the weight lambda of [Weighted Shortest Path and All Shortest Paths
  algoritms](https://memgraph.com/docs/advanced-algorithms/built-in-graph-algorithms)
  uses node properties, it will include all nodes of the path, even the start
  and end nodes. Also it's possible to mix node and relationships properties, by
  coalescing the relationship property in the weight lambda.
  [#1434](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1434)
- There have been changes to `mgp.hpp` method in the C++ API.
  [#1536](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1536)

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- If results of [aggregation
  functions](https://memgraph.com/docs/querying/functions#aggregation-functions)
  are returned grouped or if there is no input to aggregate over, rather than
  returing `0` or `empty` together with `NULL`, the functions won't return
  anything. [#1531](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1531)
- If the initialisation CYPHERL file passed using the
  [`--init-file`](https://memgraph.com/docs/configuration/configuration-settings#other)
  configuration flag tries to create a user that already exists, the exception
  will be caught and Memgraph will start successfully.
  [#1465](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1465)
- All deleted relationships are now correctly replicated to REPLICA instances.
  Also, replication failures no longer prevent MAIN to write into WAL files.
  [#1540](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1540)
- The cartesian evaluation of three MATCH clauses no longer uses sequential
  scanning, thus improving the performance of such queries.
  [#1555](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1555)
- A bug was fixed that would MATCH and RETURN wrong grouped aggregations.
  [#1518](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1518)
- Memgraph no longer throws a "Failed deallocation" error when working with the
  [`migrate` query module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/migrate).
  [#1492](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1492)
-  The [C, C++ and Python APIs](/custom-query-modules) have been extended with
  functions to check what storage mode is being used and whether graph elements
  (or lists/maps thereof) have been deleted. They allow the proper handling of
  deleted return values or query procedures and functions ran in [the
  in-memory analytical storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#implications) are now properly
  handled.[#1395](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1395)
- A bug was fixed where Memgraph would send a success message to clients before
  certain database operations were executed successfully.
  [#1556](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1556)

## Lab v2.10.0 - Dec 8, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- OpenAI LLM integration enables you to query the database using the English language instead of writing Cypher queries.
- After each query run, query summary, statistics, and database notifications are now shown in the result summary
  tab.

## MAGE v1.12.1 - Nov 21, 2023

- Changes to internal utilities. [#415](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/415)

## Memgraph v2.12.1 - Nov 17, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- Cached query plans are no longer saved during the time interval defined by the
  `--query-plan-cache-ttl`, rather they are cached by count. You can set the
  maximum number of cached query plans using the `--query-plan-cache-max-size`
  [configuration flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#query). By deafult,
  the maximum number of cached query plans is
  1000. This change has been made to reduce the memory usage of queries with
  `MERGE` queries and variables.
  [#1348](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1348)
- Procedures are no longer limited to 100 MB. They can use unlimited resources.
  If you want to [limit memory usage of
  procedures](/custom-query-modules/manage-query-modules#controlling-procedure-memory-usage)
  add `PROCEDURE MEMORY LIMIT 100 KB` after calling a procedure and before
  yielding results. [#1506](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1506)
- The [`SHOW STORAGE INFO;`](/configuration/server-stats) query now returns the
  non-swapped physical RAM memory a task has used (as reported by the operating
  system) as `memory_res`, not `memory_usage`. `memory allocated` has been
  replaced with `memory_tracked`, and it still defines the amount of RAM
  allocated in the system and tracked by Memgraph. The query also returns the
  number of memory-mapped areas that the kernel allows a process to have as
  `vm_max_map_count`. [#1408](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1408)
  [#1426](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1426)
- Now you can delete all nodes and relationships on a path by using the
  following `DETACH DELETE` syntax: [`MATCH p = (:X)-->()-->()-->() DETACH
  DELETE p;`](/querying/read-and-modify-data#delete-data).
  [#1383](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1383)
- After
  [recovery](https://memgraph.com/docs/configuration/data-durability-and-backup#restore-data),
  the logs show which indexes and constraints have been recovered.
  [#1480](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1480)
- Information about using custom memory resources for handling memory when
  running has been removed from the [logs](/configuration/logs) as it's
  unecessary. [#1452](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1425)
- All the memory allocated inside a procedure is tracked in order to notify when
  limits are reached. [#1443](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1443)
- [`date` and `localTime`](/querying/functions#temporal-functions) can now be
  extracted from `LocalDateTime` data type.
  [#1381](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1381)

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Query modules [`schema`](/querying/functions#schema) and
  [`convert`](/querying/functions#conversion-functions) that had been moved from
  MAGE library to Memgraph now load properly and work as expected.
  [#1490](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1490)
- Instead of crashing the database, using the
  [`exists()`](/querying/functions#pattern-functions) function with any clause
  other than WHERE throws an exception.
  [#1392](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1392)
  [#1382](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1382)
- The [`MEMORY QUERY LIMIT`
  queries](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#control-query-memory-usage) now
  respect the memory limit as expected.
  [#1468](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1468)
- Queries using indexed join no longer crash.
  [#1478](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1478)
- Indexes can now be loaded in parallel as expected.
  [#1479](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1479)
- The [`collect` function](/querying/functions#aggregation-functions), when
  called on an empty list, now yields no results instead of returning `NULL`.
  [#1482](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1482)
- Using the `WHERE` and `IN` subclauses with lists now works as expected.
  [#1494](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1494)
- The hash join executes as expected when using WHERE subclause.
  [#1496](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1496)
- When encountering corrupted [snapshot and WAL
  files](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup#durability-mechanisms) during
  recovery, Memgraph now deletes them.
  [#1385](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1385)
- The snapshot thread is now stopped when switching from
  `IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL` to `IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL` [storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#storage-modes). Before, the snapshot
  thread was left running in the ANALYTICAL mode although it was unnecessary.
  [#1385](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1385)
- When setting properties to all nodes at once using the `SET` subclause via
  client library, the number of set properties is returned as expected.
  [#1460](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1460)
- Passing a variable that contains a list to the [BFS
  algorithm](/advanced-algorithms/built-in-graph-algorithms#breadth-first-search)
  now returns a results instead of an exception.
  [#1380](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1380)
- Upon deleting data, garbage collector deallocates memory as expected.
  [#1471](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1471)
- If you call a procedure that works on multiple threads and they pass the
  memory allocation limit, an exception will be thrown. Until now RAM
  suffered in silence. [#1401](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1401)

## Lab v2.9.1 - Nov 15, 2023

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Memory and disk usage are now presented in KiB, MiB, and GiB instead of KB,
  MB, and GB.
- Memory usage is not N/A anymore, it shows the correct value for Memgraph
  versions higher than `2.12.1`.

## Memgraph v2.12.0 - Nov 1, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- Snapshot and WAL files version have been updated. Snapshot and WAL files
  created with Memgraph v2.12 and higher won't be usable in previous versions of
  Memgraph (v2.11.1 and lower).
  [#1281](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1281)
- Memgraph can now start the instance in any [storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#storage-modes), defined by the
  `--storage-mode` [configuration
  flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage).
- The [`SHOW STORAGE INFO;`](/configuration/server-stats) query now returns
  memory allocations in B, KiB, MiB, GiB or TiB, rather than just B to make the
  information easily
  readable.[#1366](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1366)
- [Client libraries](/client-libraries) you can use to connect to Memgraph are
  now able to retry the queries in order to complete the transactions
  successfully. [#1361](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1361)
- Information about the graph after running the [`ANALYZE
  GRAPH;`](/querying/performance-optimization#analyze-graph) is now persistent
  between instance reruns.
  [#1281](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1281)
- Now, you can employ [index
  hints](/querying/performance-optimization#index-hinting) by adding the 
  `USE INDEX` subclause to the `CREATE INDEX` query to fine-tune the planner
  behavior. [#1345](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1345)
- In certain situations, Memgraph returns a hint to create
  [indexes](/fundamentals/indexes) to speed up read queries.
  [#1343](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1343)
- The `SHOW INDEX INFO;` now also returns the information about the number of
  assigned indexes. [#1229](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1229)
- Now, you can [register REPLICA
  instances](/configuration/replication#registering-replica-instances) using DNS
  names. [#1323](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1323)
- You can now use [`keys()` and `values()` functions](/querying/functions#maps)
  to get a list of keys and values of a map.
  [#1246](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1246)
- You can now use `schema` procedures to get information about nodes and
  relationships or `convert.str2object()` function to convert strings to objects
  using Python's `json.dumps` function.
  [#1384](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1384)
- In your [custom query modules](/custom-query-modules), you can now remove the
  last element of a path in [C++ API](/custom-query-modules/cpp) using
  `path.Pop()`, [C API](/custom-query-modules/c) using `mgp_path_pop` and
  [Python API](/custom-query-modules/python) using `path.pop()`.
  [#1249](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1249)
- [`KeyExists` function](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api#keyexists) that
  checks the existance of a key in a map has been added to the C++ API.
  [#1336](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1336)
- You can now change the relationship type using `mgp::Graph::ChangeType` in [C++
  API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api) and `mgp::graph_edge_change_type` in
  [C API](/custom-query-modules/c/c-api).
  [#1364](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1364)
- Reading of nodes [stored on
  disk](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#storage-modes) is now 2x faster.
  [#1266](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1266)
- Searching for relationships stored on disk is now faster due to the ability to
  expand from a single node, rather than searching through all relationships.
  [#1335](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1335)
- Due to several smaller improvements, Memgraph uses less memory and the garbage
  collection is more efficient.
  [#1387](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1387)
- The [query inspection](/querying/performance-optimization#inspecting-queries)
  report using `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` clauses now provides information about the
  operands of the `Filter` operator.
  [#1265](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1265)
- Queries that have multiple `MATCH` clauses and the results are joined in a
  `WHERE` clause now execute more efficiently, due to the to the new [`HashJoin`
  operator](/querying/performance-optimization#operators).
  [#1226](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1226)
- The new [Cartesian product
  operator](/querying/performance-optimization#cartesian-product) optimizes
  queries that match nodes without relationship.

- Filtering and producing expressions in WITH and FILTER clauses have been
  optimized by adding cache.
  [#1432](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1432)
- The verification of [unique and existence
  constraints](/fundamentals/constraints) has been optimized. Constraints are
  now verified only when updating node labels or properties, as updates on
  relationships do not influence constraints.
  [#1341](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1341)

 {<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- The `DISTINCT` clause no longer influences other aggregates, that is, shows
  distinct values as exepcted. [#1235](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1235)
- Any attempt to change the isolation level in in-memory analytical and on-disk
  storage mode will throw an exception. [#1367](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1367)

- There are no longer data discrepancies between a REPLICA instance which is
  syncin with a new MAIN instance that became MAIN by being upgraded from the
  REPLICA role. [#1370](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1370)
- A bug has been fixed which would shut down Memgraph when fetching data from SQL
  database. [#1299](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1299)
- When setting a memory limit using [`--memory-limit` config
  flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#other), Memgraph now stops the
  transactions exceeding the limit as expected.
  [#1250](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1250)
  [#1340](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1340)
- Memgraph now throws an exception when its out of memory, insted of not
  reporting an issue. [#1379](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1379)
- Running a `DELETE DETACH` query on a non-existing relationship will no longer
  crash the database. [#1335](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1355)

## MAGE v1.12.0 - Nov 1, 2023

- With the new [`algo`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/algo) query

  delete certain nodes in a path from the graph and reconnect the path and
  normalize properties to boolean values.
  [#376](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/376)
- You no longer need the MAGE library to run `schema` procedures and get
  information about nodes and relationships or `convert.str2object()` function
  to convert strings to objects using Python's `json.dumps` function.

- `Node Properties()` and `Relationship Properties()` getter from the [C++
  API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api) changed return type from `std::map` to
  `std::unordered_map` to speed up execution time. This is a breaking change so
  check your C++ query modules for possible code changes.
  [#1131](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1131)

- The import of relationships in [on-disk storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#on-disk-transactional-storage-mode) can be
  improved by activating the `EDGE IMPORT MODE ACTIVE;`. When `EDGE IMPORT MODE`
  is disabled, the engine can import around 180 relationships per second. When
  active, the engine can import around 7500 relationships per second.
  [#1157](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1157).
- The following [configurational
  settings](/configuration/configuration-settings) can now be changed during
  runtime: server name, query execution timeout, log level and the option to log
  to `stderr`. Use the following queries to set the configuration:
  ```
  SET DATABASE SETTING 'server.name' TO 'new-name';
  SET DATABASE SETTING 'query.timeout' TO '100';
  SET DATABASE SETTING 'log.level' TO 'TRACE';
  SET DATABASE SETTING 'log.to_stderr' TO 'true`;
  ```
  [#1183](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1183)
- The default value of
  [`--bolt-server-name-for-init`](/configuration/configuration-settings#bolt) is
  now `Neo4j/v5.11.0 compatible graph database server - Memgraph`.
  [#1183](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1183)
- During recovery from a snapshot, the recovery of each graph object or property
  is no longer logged in the TRACE setting. The log now only indicates the
  recovery progress. [#1054](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1054)
- There have been various updates that improved performance:
  - Updating indexes and constraints has been streamlined, significantly improving
    execution time for everybody making heavy use of them.
    [#1159](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1159) [#1142](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1142)
  - Queries that build maps with multiple same-variable property lookups have been
    optimized. [#1168](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1168)
  - The batch update of properties improves performance when setting a large
    number of properties, as in this example:
    ```
    FOREACH (i in range(0, 1000000) | CREATE (n:Label {id:i}));

    CREATE INDEX ON :Label(id);

    FOREACH (i IN range(0, 1000000, 3) | MERGE (n:Label {id:i}) SET n += {prop2:"a1", prop3:"b2", prop4:"c3", prop5:"d4", prop6:"e5", prop7:"f6", prop8:"g7", prop9:"h8", prop10:"i9", prop11:"j10 q"});
    ```
    [#1115](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1115)
  - Setting properties is also improved by caching mappings of property name to
    internal property `id`. [#1147](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1147)
  - Performance has been improved for concurrent operations contending on the same
    node. [#1187](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1187)
  - When a query is executing in many iterations over the graph entities, the
    performance has been improved by 100% due to faster scanning of nodes, for example:
    ```
    UNWIND RANGE (1, 500) AS i CREATE ();
    MATCH (),(),() RETURN COUNT(*);
    ```
    [#1127](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1227)
  - The query engine is more performant as at all times it is scanning and
    expanding nodes instead of scanning both source and destination nodes and
    then expanding to the relationship between them.
    [#1085](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1085)
  - The expansion of node is no longer only done from left to right. Depending on
    the previous executions and how many relationships needed to be check on
    MERGE, the engine knows the fewest vector necessary to expand.
    [#1110](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1110)
  - The performance of `DETACH DELETE` query has been improved.
  [#1078](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1078)
- When developing [custom query modules](/custom-query-modules), node and
  relationship properties can now be changed in bulk, rather than one by one.
  [#1131](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1131)
- Changes to [the C++ API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api):
  - Users can now call `ToString()` method on `mgp::Value` and Memgraph's data
    types when writing query modules using C++ API.
    [#1140](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1140)
  - Trigger functions can now access deleted vertices from deleted edge when
    processed. [#1209](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1209)
  - When developing query modules using C++ API, you can now get the `In` and
    `Out` degrees of a node in O(1) time complexity. [#1217](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1217)
  - The C++ API now enables you to change relationship start (from) and end (to)
    nodes with `mgp::Graph.SetFrom` and `mgp::Graph.SetTo` methods.
- `SHOW INDEX INFO` now displays index information in alphabetic order for
  easier orientation. [#1178](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1178)
- The `PROFILE` query now generates a table with operators in the same order as
  in the plan constructed with the `EXPLAIN` query.
  [#1024](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1204)
- Certain queries execute faster due to the usage of custom allocators for
  [Delta
  objects](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup#write-ahead-logging).
  [#1129](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1129)

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Setting a property of a node labeled `null` will no longer crash the database,
  but return an exception. [#1175](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1175)

## MAGE v1.11.0. - Sep 13, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- The [`export_util`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/export_util) has
  been expanded and now allows exporting query results, as well as graph nodes
  and relationships to a CSV file format. [#325](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/325)
- With the
  [`export_util`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/export_util) you can

  [#327](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/327)
- The [import_util](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/import_util) can
  now also import data from graphML files. [#327](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/327)
- The new [`util_module`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/util_module)
  offers a range of functions for tasks such as validation and creating
  cryptographic hash values. This module serves as a practical resource for
  streamlining a variety of tasks related to database operations.
  [#311](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/311)
- The [`node` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/node) provides a
  comprehensive toolkit for managing individual graph nodes, enabling creation,
  deletion, updating, merging, and more.
  [#315](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/315)
- The [`nodes` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/nodes) provides
  a comprehensive toolkit for managing multiple graph nodes, enabling linking,
  updating, type deduction and more.
  [#312](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/312)
- By enabling more precise and flexible creation of nodes and relationships
  within the graph structure, the [`create`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/create) enhances the ability
  of developers to model, manipulate, and query complex graph data.
  [#307](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/307)
- The [`meta` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/meta) provides a
  set of procedures for generating metadata about the database.
  [#296](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/296)
- The [`path` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/path) allows
  users to explore different paths, filter relationships, and nodes based on
  specific criteria, and achieve more complex path-related tasks that go beyond
  the capabilities of native Cypher - whether you're seeking all possible paths
  between two nodes, subgraphs that meet certain conditions, or various other
  path-oriented operations. [#313](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/313)
- The [`refactor` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor)
  provides utilities for changing nodes and relationships.
  [#342](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/342)
- The [`xml_module`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/xml_module)
  enhances graph database capabilities by providing support for loading and
  parsing XML data. [#329](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/329)
- The [`convert` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/convert) is
  used for conversion of one data type to another.

  relationships to a specified node, enabling an examination of the immediate
  connections within the graph and thereby gaining insights into the network
  structure and connectivity. [#308](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/308)
- The [`temporal` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/temporal)
  enables more sophisticated manipulation, conversion, and calculation of date
  and time. These functions handle temporal (time-related) operations and offer
  extended capabilities compared to the
  [`date`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/date) functions.
  [#299](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/299)

## Lab v2.8.2 - Sep 13, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- Prepared datasets are now loaded 20-30 times faster, and 150 times faster if the
  database is in the [in-memory analyitcal storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#in-memory-analytical-storage-mode) on Memgraph > 2.9.
- You will be warned if your custom CYPHERL dataset import fails during the
  import process.
- After being generated, the graph schema is cached and you can always
  regenerate it.
- Run queries will now show the full roundtrip time spent on the query instead
  of just how much Memgraph spent on the query. You will still have the ability
  to see the segmentation and how much each component of query parsing,
  planning, and execution spent time on the query (also shows seconds, and
  minutes if needed, e.g. ##.## s).

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Map is now shown as expected when applying the System default Graph Style
  Script.

## Memgraph v2.10.1 - Aug 22, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- Removing properties from relationships with `RemoveProperty()` function in
  [C++
  API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api).
  [#1156](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1156)
- Improved performance on batch update of properties, e.g., `MATCH (n) SET n += {prop1:1, prop2:2, ...};`
  [#1115](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1115)
- When working at a snapshot isolation level, if a certain graph object is
  changed multiple times as a part of one of many parallel transactions, the
  delta chain tracking its changes becomes very long. Other parallel transaction
  with snapshot insolation that started before the modifications and dependent
  on that object need to access and process that delta chain to get its correct
  state, which can be very expensive regarding CPU usage. Now, Memgraph is
  caching delta chains of 128 or more changes, which eliminates the need of
  processing the chain and improves performance. If you would benefit from
  changing at what length the delta chain should be cashed, adjust the value of
  the [`--delta-chain-cache-threshold` configuration
  flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#other).
  [#1124](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1124).

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- The same query module can now be executed concurrently by different clients
  without issues. [#1158](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1158)

## MAGE v1.10.0 - Aug 23, 2023

{<h3> Features and improvements </h3>}

- You can use the [`label`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/label) to check whether a
  node has the given label. [#304](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/304)
- Time zones don’t have to be difficult to work with. The [`date`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/date) provides utilities for
  date and time operations. [#291](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/291)
- The [`text` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/text) simplifies
  string concatenation and supports custom delimiters.
  [#287](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/287)

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- LLM prompts returned by the [`llm_util`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/llm_util) now list node and relationship
  properties in a consistent order.
  [#324](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/324)

## Lab v2.8.1 - Aug 22, 2023

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Quick connect will now try to connect to Memgraph on `127.0.0.1` instead of
  `localhost` because it is not always clear what `localhost` will be resolved
  to.
- Paths in query results now return a correct presentation instead of an empty
  path when there is only one node in the path.
- On hard refresh of the Lab application, you are now redirected to the correct
  connection screen.
- Logs no longer scroll automatically to new log records when you scroll up to
  check past log records.

## Memgraph v2.10.1 - Aug 22, 2023

{<h3> Improvements and bug fixes </h3>}

- Improved performance on batch update of properties, e.g.:

  ```cypher
  MATCH (n) SET n += {prop1:1, prop2:2, ...};
  ```
  [#1115](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1115)
- Added a delta cache to improve query performance. This helps in situations of
  repeated reads of vertices which have many delta changes caused by another
  transaction while the current transaction is operating with snapshot isolation
  level and so needs to process those deltas. This can be tuned using
  `--delta-chain-cache-threshold`.
  [#1124](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1124)
- Concurrent access to the same query module had a race-condition on the
  pointer that was used to handle the custom memory management. A mapping has
  been added that keeps the information about what thread used what pointer to
  handle the memory resources, which should be fine since the respected query
  executions are running on a dedicated thread. Access to the mapping itself is
  thread-safe. A simple `RWLock` has been implemented here, as we shouldn't
  include `memgraph::utils` from this header and a traditional mutex might be
  overkill. A simple RAII wrapper for the mapping container has been also added
  for simpler client-side use.
  [#1158](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1158)

## Lab v2.8.0 - Aug 04, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- You can now save and edit connection details so you don't have to type them in
  on every reconnect.
- A list of recent connections is now shown in the sidebar and you can use it to
  quickly connect to any of the recent successful connections.
- When you click on a node or relationship in the Graph View, the object
  properties will be shown in a sidebar next to the Graph View rather then on
  the canvas next to the object.
- Nodes can be expanded by a double-click.
- As Memgraph now supports multi-tenant architecture, you can see the database
  you are currently working in the status bar with an option to switch to another
  database.
- Along with the number of nodes and relationships in the database, the status
  bar now also shows the number of indexes, constraints, and triggers.
- Now you can recenter, zoom in and zoom out the graph view by clicking on the
  action buttons in the bottom right corner of the Graph Results view.
- Now you can copy query results to the clipboard in JSON, CSV, or TSV format.
- You can start a name of a variable in Graph Style Script with an underscore
  `_` which is pretty handy for defining local variables in `@NodeStyle` and
  `@EdgeStyle` directives.

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Setting up the `z-index` for edges in Graph Style Script now works as expected.
- Large integer numbers in query table results are now shown correctly, e.g. it
  shows `10,000,000,000,000,001` for the query `RETURN 10000000000000000 + 1`
  instead of incorrect result `10000000000000000`.
- Results now correctly show "No results" when there are no results in the query
  response, instead of a previously fetched result.
- The Lab web application is no longer unexpectedly crashing when using the
  Memgraph Platform Docker image.

## MAGE v1.9.0 - Aug 03, 2023

{<h3> Features and improvements </h3>}

- With the new [`collections` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/collections) you can
  filter, sort and modify lists within Cypher queries.
  [#284](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/284)
- The new [`map` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/map) enables manipulating
  collections of key-value pairs, and consequently advanced data operations
  within a graph database context.
  [#282](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/282)

## Memgraph v2.10.0 - Aug 2, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- The new [multi-tenant support](/configuration/multi-tenancy) available in
  the Enterprise Edition of Memgraph enables you to manage multiple isolated
  databases within a single instance. The primary objective is to facilitate
  efficient resource isolation, maintain data integrity, and manage access for
  different clients. [#952](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/952)
- The configuration flag `storage-recover-on-startup` has been deprecated and
  replaced with `data_recovery_on_startup`to support multi-tenancy. The
  `storage-recover-on-startup` can still be used until the next release planned
  for mid-September.
- If you want to replace procedure names your application calls without changing
  the application code, you can define the mapping of the old and new procedure
  names in a JSON file, then set the path to the files as the value of the
  `query-callable-mappings-path` [configuration
  flag](/configuration/configuration-settings).
  [#1018](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1018)
- The [C++
  API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api)
  for writing custom query modules now enables:
  - inserting `mgp::Any` datatype into Record. [#1094](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1094)
  - comparing two `mgp::Value` variables with the `<` operator. [#1090](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1090)
  - printing the type of `mgp::Type` enumeration using the `<<` operator. For
  example, if you have a `mgp::List` list, `cout<< list <<endl` will output
  `"list"`. [#1080](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1080)
  - printing `mgp::Value` variables (except `mgp::Path`, `mgp::List` and
    `mgp::Map` types) using the `<<` operator.
    [#1127](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1127)
  - using the `mgp::Value` variables and all its subtypes (`mgp::Map`,
    `mgp::Path`, ...) inside hash structures such as `std::unordered_map` and
    `std::unordered_set`. [#1093](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1093)
  - deleting and updating map elements with `mgp::Map.Update(key, &value)`,
    `mgp::Map.Update(key, &&value)` and `mgp::Map.Erase(key)` functions.
    [#1103](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1103)
  - removing properties from nodes with `RemoveProperty()` function and labels
    with `RemoveLabel()` function.
    [#1128](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1128)
    [#1126](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1126)

  Also, the `mgp::Value` wrapper for Memgraph's data types has been extended to
  return subtypes which are modifiable (non-const).
  [#1099](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1099)
- The [C
  API](/custom-query-modules/c/c-api)
  for writing custom query modules now enables:
    - deleting and updating map elements with `mgp_map_update(map, key, value)`
  and `mgp_map_erase(map, key)` functions. [#1103](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1103)
    - removing labels from nodes with `RemoveLabel()` function.
      [#1126](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1126)
- Memgraph supports transaction timeouts defined by the Bolt protocol if the
  connection to the database is established via the [JavaScript
  client](/client-libraries/javascript).
  [#1046](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1046)
- Queries exploring all shortest paths now use considerably less memory without
  significant performance deterioration.
  [#981](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/981)
- Users with fine grained privileges will experience better performance when
  running queries due to user information cashing. Any changes to the user
  privileges will be ignored until the next login.
  [#1109](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1109)

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Connection with Bolt v5.2 now works as expected when returning a path as a
  result. [#1108](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1108)
- Serializing vertex and edge properties to RocksDB now works as expected even
  when the serialization buffer is exactly 15B.
  [#1111](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1111)
- Users created in the Community Edition remain valid after the instance is
  upgraded to an Enterprise Edition. [#1067](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1067)

## Memgraph v2.9.0 - Jul 21, 2023

<Callout type="warning">

Memgraph 2.9 introduced a new configuration flag
`--replication-restore-state-on-startup` which is `false` by default.

If you want instances to remember their role and configuration in a replication
cluster upon restart, the `--replication-restore-state-on-startup` needs to be
set to `true` when first initializing the instances and remain `true` throughout
the instances' lifetime.

When reinstating a cluster it is advised to first initialize the MAIN
instance, then the REPLICA instances.

</Callout>

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- The new [`ON_DISK_TRANSACTIONAL` storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage) allows you to store data on disk
  rather than in-memory. Check the implementation and implications in the
  reference guide. [#850](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/850)
- Memgraph now works with all Bolt v5.2 drivers.
  [#938](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/938)
- The [LOAD CSV clause](/data-migration/csv) has several new improvements:
  - You can now import data from web-hosted CSV files by passing the URL as a
    file location. You can also import files compressed with `gzip` or `bzip2`
    algorithms. [#1027](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1027)
  - To speed up the execution of the `LOAD CSV` clause, you can add `MATCH` and
    `MERGE` entities prior to reading the rows from a CSV file. But, the `MATCH`
    or `MERGE` clause has to return just one row or Memgraph will throw an
    exception. [#916](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/916)
  - If a certain sequence of characters in a CSV file needs to be imported as
    null, you can now specify them with the NULLIF option of the LOAD CSV
    clause. [#914](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/914)
- You can now use `mgp::Type::Any` while developing a custom query procedure
  with [the C++
  API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api)
  to specify that the argument of the procedure can be of any type.
  [#982](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/982)
- When you need to differentiate transactions, you can now define and pass
  [transaction metadata](/fundamentals/transactions) via the client and check it in Memgraph by running the
  `SHOW TRANSACTIONS;` query.
  [#945](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/945)
- You can now create [custom batch procedures in Python and
  C++](/custom-query-modules)
  that process data in batches, thus consuming less memory.
[#964](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/964)
- The [`ANALYZE GRAPH;` query](/querying/performance-optimization) now includes information about the degree of all
  nodes to enhance the MERGE optimizations on supernodes.
  [#1026](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1026)
- The `--replication-restore-state-on-startup` configuration flag allows you to
  define whether instances in the [replication
  cluster](/configuration/replication) will regain their roles upon restart
  (`true`) or restart as disconnected "blank" MAIN instances (default setting
  `false`). This flag resolved the unwanted behavior of restarted REPLICA
  instances disconnecting from the cluster, but it also needs to be introduced
  to MAIN instances so they are not disconnected from the cluster upon restart.
  [#791](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/791)

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- `init-file` and `init-data-file` configuration flags allow the execution of
  queries from a CYPHERL file, prior to or immediately after the Bolt server
  starts and are now possible to configure in the Community Edition as well.
  [#850](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/850)
- The IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL storage mode now deallocates memory as expected and
  no longer consumes memory excessively. [#1025](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1025)
- When no values are returned from a map, a null is returned instead of an
  exception occurring. [#1039](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1039)

## MAGE v1.8.0 - Jul 21, 2023

{<h3> Features and improvements </h3>}

- With the [`llm_util` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/llm_util) you can generate a graph schema in a format best
  suited for large language models (LLMs).
  [#225](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/225)
- When executing complex queries, the [`periodic`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/periodic) allows batching results from one query
  into another to improve execution time.
  [#221](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/221)
- The [`conditional_execution`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/conditional_execution) which allows the
  execution of different queries depending on certain conditions being met, has
  been rewritten from Python to C++ to improve performance and it can also
  periodically iterates. [#222](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/222)
- The [`migrate` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/migrate) has the option to get data from MySQL, SQL server, or
  Oracle DB to migrate it to Memgraph.
  [#209](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/209)

## Lab v2.7.1 - Jul 05, 2023

{<h3> Improvements </h3>}

- System Default style has been renamed to System Style.
- If you run a query that has errors in the Graph Style Script code, you can
  decide to run it using the System Style.

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Bug that would allow multiple styles to be the default has been fixed.
- The System Default Style now has `background-color` set to white.
- Queries selected in the Query Editor now execute as expected.
- Creating and editing a query module as well as selecting a transformation
  module in the Streams section now work as expected.
- All links are now linked with appropriate external resources.
- The pop-up window in the Run History that allows rerunning the query now
  closes once an option is selected.

## Lab v2.7.0 - Jun 28, 2023

{<h3> What's new </h3>}

- Now you can adjust the following settings:
  - Code completion and automatic graph rendering limits
  - The capacity of run history and its clearing
  - The limit for visible logs

  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/settings.png)
- The new interfaces for managing saved styles enables searching and changing
  the default style in the Lab. The saved styles now also have a preview.
  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/styles.png)
- The run history now also tracks changes to the query, style, or both. You can
  also filter out records to show All (both queries runs and applied styles),
  Query history (only query runs), and Style history (only applied style
  changes). You can expand both the query and style to see the full Cypher or
  GSS code.
  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/run_history.png)
  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/run_history_expand.png)
  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/run_history_queries.png)
- Queries inside a collection can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on their
  name.
- When testing and trying out different functions in the GSS you can use
  single-line (`// comment`) and multi-line (`/* comment */`) comments in the
  GSS code editor without losing previous state.
- Change the canvas color of the graph view with the new property
  `background-color` in [`@ViewStyle`](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/directive-properties).
- Change the stack order of how nodes and edges are rendered in the graph view
  with the property `z-index` in
  [`@NodeStyle`](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/directive-properties) and
  [`@EdgeStyle`](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/directive-properties) directives. It works
  the same as the CSS z-index property.
- Set up transparent colors with the [new GSS
  functions](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/built-in-elements) `RGBA` and `HSLA`. You can also get
  the transparency value with the function `Alpha`.
- [New functions](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/built-in-elements) allow more customizations: `Sort`, `Coalesce`, `Reverse`,
  `IsMap`, `AsMap`, `Execute`, `Get`, `Set`, `Del`, `MapKeys`, `MapValues`,
  `AsIterator`, `IsIterator`, `Next`
- [Global and local
    variables](/data-visualization/graph-style-script#caching-results-for-faster-performance)
    make developing new styles easier:
  - Variable graph is now available outside `@NodeStyle` and `@EdgeStyle`
    context
  - Local variables can be defined with `Define` within `@NodeStyle` and
    `@EdgeStyle` context
- Memgraph Lab is now packaged as an RPM package and arm64 (M1 chip) for MacOS.

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Running a selected part of the Cypher query would just place that selected
  part in the run history. Now, the full query will be saved in the run history,
  and on its run, only the selected part will be executed again.
- Rows that would hide when scrolling the data results view now preview as expected.
- The System Default style colors all the nodes with the same label with a
  unique color.
- When showing a graph view on a map, you will no longer see a progress
  percentage which is unnecessary as each node has a fixed and known position
  due to its latitude and longitude values.
- All tables across the Lab are responsive as expected.
- Layouts no longer cause memory leaks and work as expected.
- By fixing a bug, you can now successfully connect to Memgraph using a hostname
  that contains numbers in the top-level domain.
- Markdown lists in query descriptions are indented as expected.

## Memgraph v2.8.0 - May 18, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- Data recovery is now up to 6x faster depending on the number of available
  cores, as [snapshot loading is distributed among several
  threads](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup#snapshots).
  [#868](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/868)
- During the recovery, indexes can also  be created using multiple threads, thus
  speeding up the process. [#882](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/882)
- In the Enterprise Edition, Memgraph now [exposes system
  metrics](/configuration/monitoring-server) via an HTTP endpoint, so
  you can get information about transactions, query latency and various other
  properties. [#940](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/940)
- It’s now possible to use the [map projection
  syntax](/fundamentals/data-types#maps) to create maps. Map
  projections are convenient for building maps based on existing values and they
  are used by data access tools like GraphQL.
  [#892](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/892)
- You can now check if [the data directory](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup) is
  (un)locked with the `DATA DIRECTORY LOCK STATUS;` query.
  [#933](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/933)
- You can now check the current [storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage) and [isolation
  levels](/fundamentals/transactions) by running the `SHOW STORAGE INFO;`
  query. [#883](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/883)
- Check the suspected [build type of the Memgraph
  executable](/configuration/server-stats#build-information) by
  running the `SHOW BUILD INFO;` query.
  [#894](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/894)
- Performance has been improved by optimizing the deallocation of resources in
  Memgraph's custom `PoolResource` memory allocator.
  [#898](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/898)

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- Running Python procedures now consume less memory.
  [#932](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/932)
- Memory allocation in LOAD CSV queries has been optimized to avoid performance
  degradation. [#877](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/877)
- Query profiles of the LOAD CSV queries now show the correct values of memory
  usage. [#885](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/885)

## Lab v2.6.0 - Apr 20, 2023

{<h3> What's new </h3>}

- If you execute multiple Cypher queries, you can now view the result of each
  query instead of viewing just the last result.
  ![results](/pages/release-notes/lab-260/results.png)
- Besides exporting query results to JSON, you can also export them to CSV and
  TSV file format.
  ![download](/pages/release-notes/lab-260/download.png)
- If the dataset contains millions or billions nodes and relationships, their
  count in the status bar will be in the following format: X.XXM or X.XXB.
- Syntax of code blocks in the query collection description can now be
  highlighted by using one of the following language
  styles: `cypher`, `bash`, `python`, `css`, `c`, `cpp`, `json`, `sql`,
  and `yaml`. Check the examples of syntax highlighting in the [Markdown
  Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting).
  ![markdown](/pages/release-notes/lab-260/markdown.png)
- [New functions of the Graph Style Script
  language](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/built-in-elements) used for customizing graph appearance
  are: `Reduce`, `Sum`, `Avg`, `Min`, `Max`, `IsArray`, `Hue`, `Saturation`,
  `Lightness`, `HSL`.
  ![gss](/pages/release-notes/lab-260/gss.png)

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- The initial node count has been removed from the connection initialization so
  connecting to the Memgraph instance containing a huge number of nodes will no
  longer cause a timeout.
- Run History now logs queries as expected.
- When switching between the map view and the default view the graph view no
  longer becomes unresponsive.
- Using a new line character `\n` in the query module doesn’t result in a new
  line, but an explicit character `\n`.
- Viewing the code of multiple query modules in the split screen now
  works as expected.
- Notifications no longer mix with the Query Editor and Query Collections visual
  elements.
- Pressing CMD/CTRL + S will save a query within a query collection execution section as intended.
- The autosave in query collection is now triggered on every query run as it was
  intended.
- Running a selected portion of the query won’t remove the rest of the query
  from the query collection execution view.
- GSS `Blue` function was returning a wrong number. It is fixed now. `Lighter`
  and `Darker` functions now work correctly as well because they were depending
  on the output from the `Blue` function.

## Memgraph v2.7.0 - Apr 5, 2023

{<h3> New features and improvements </h3>}

- You can now choose between [two different storage modes](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage):
  - Transactional mode - the default database mode that favors
    strongly-consistent ACID transactions using WAL files and periodic
    snapshots, but requires more time and resources during data import and
    analysis.
  - Analytical mode - speeds up import and data analysis but offers no ACID
    guarantees besides manually created snapshots.
  Switch between modes within the session using the `STORAGE MODE
  IN_MEMORY_{TRANSACTIONAL|ANALYTICAL};` query. [#772](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/772)
- You can now call [subqueries](/querying/clauses/call) inside existing queries using the CALL clause.
  [#794](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/794)
- When you want to filter data using properties that all have label:property
  indexes set, you can make Memgraph analyze the properties on all or several
  labels with the [`ANALYZE GRAPH;`
  query](/fundamentals/indexes#analyze-graph). By calculating the
  distribution of property values, Memgraph will be able to select the optimal
  index for the query and it will execute faster.
  [#812](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/812)
- If, for example, you are no longer interested in the results of the query you
  ran, or the procedure you built is running in an infinite loop, you can [stop
  the transaction](/fundamentals/transactions#managing-transactions)
  with the `TERMINATE TRANSACTIONS tid;` query; Find out the transaction ID with
  `SHOW TRANSACTIONS;` query.
  [#790](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/790)
- With the [new flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#other)
  `password-encryption-algorithm` you can choose between `bcrypt`, `sha256`, and
  `sha256-multiple` encryption algorithms. SHA256 offers better performance
  compared to the more secure but less performant bcrypt.
  [#839](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/839)
- Import using the [LOAD CSV clause](/data-migration/csv) has
  been further improved by using a memory allocator which will reuse memory
  blocks allocated while processing the `LOAD CSV` query.
  [#825](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/825)

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

- The users who have [global visibility on the
  graph](/configuration/security#label-based-access-control) will
  experience a slight improvement in performance regarding label-based access
  control as the engine no longer check privileges for each node.
  [#837](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/837)
- The [All shortest paths
  algorithm](/advanced-algorithms/built-in-graph-algorithms#all-shortest-paths)
  now supports multiedges. [#832](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/832)

## MAGE v1.7.0 - Apr 5, 2023

{<h3> Features and improvements </h3>}

- The [new conditional execution
module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/conditional_execution) lets you define
  conditions not expressible in Cypher and and use them to control query
  execution. [#203](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/203)

## MAGE v1.6.1 - Mar 20, 2023

{<h3> Features and improvements </h3>}

- With the `export_util.csv_query()` procedure, you can export query results to a CSV file or as a stream. [#199](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/199)
- Similarity algorithms (`jaccard`, `overlap` and `cosine`) have been rewritten in C++ to improve performance. [#196](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/196)

## Lab v2.5.0 - Mar 17, 2023

{<h3> What's New </h3>}

* If there are several Cypher queries in the query editor you can select a single query and run
  it without commenting out all the other queries.

![run-selected-query-in-the-lab](/pages/release-notes/lab-250/lab-run-selected-demo.gif)

* You can now open multiple query executions views side by side and compare query execution speed or results.

![multiple-query-executions-in-the-lab](/pages/release-notes/lab-250/lab-multiple-editors-demo.gif)

* Query modules are now sorted alphabetically for easier and faster browsing. A search box has also been added to query modules with more
  than 5 procedures to help narrow them down (e.g. `nxalg` query module has [49 procedures](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/nxalg)).
* When rendering a graph with more than 3,500 nodes or 8,500 relationships, which might take considerable amount of time to preview, you will be
  asked if you want to proceed with the graph visualization or switch to the data view.
* Besides manually saving changes in the Cypher query and GSS style editor in the query collections section, they will also be saved
  automatically after each query run.
* Memgraph Lab will now notify you of any product updates and offer various tips and tricks for using the Memgraph ecosystem.

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

* Cypher code suggestions can now handle labels and properties of 250k nodes and 500k relationships, compared to the previous limit of
  100k nodes nad 200k relationships.
* Multiple scrollable elements of the query collections was making scrolling difficult. Now you can focus on a particular element and
  scroll through it by clicking on it.
* Browser's back button is now working as expected when using Lab as a web application.
* Data in the query results, query modules and query run history tables now loads faster making the scrolling smoother and improving
  the user experience.
* Graph schema is now generated even if the database has no relationships.
* In-progress feedback when generating graph schema and exporting datasets for graphs with more than 10M nodes
  is now previewed as expected.
* A scrolling issue with expanded results in the Data view where you couldn't see a completely expanded row because the
  scroll would jump to the next row is now fixed.
* Dataset cards no longer spread apart when conducting a search.

## Memgraph v2.6.0 - Mar 07, 2023

{<h3> Major features and improvements </h3>}

- Importing speed using the LOAD CSV clause has been improved due to two changes:
  -  Performance improvement in accessing values from large arrays or maps with numerous properties. [#744](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/774)
  -  Upon creating a large number of node or relationship properties, properties are stored in a property store all at once, instead of individually. [#788](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/788)
- Newly implemented `exists()` function allows using patterns as part of the filtering clause. Check the [Cypher Manual](/querying/clauses/where) for usage. [#818](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/818)
- With the new [Python mock query module API](/custom-query-modules/python/mock-python-api), you can now develop and test Python query modules for Memgraph without having to run a Memgraph instance. The mock API is compatible with the Python API and thus developed modules can be added to Memgraph as-is. [#757](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/757)
- Memgraph now supports Fedora 36 and Ubuntu 22.04 for ARM. [#787](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/787) [#810](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/810)

{<h3> Bug fixes </h3>}

-  `torch` and `igraph` can no longer be removed from the `svs.modules` cache to avoid issues after reload. [#720](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/720)
-  Newly created nodes now comply with the set label based authorization rules. [#755](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/755)
-  Constructing LocalDateTime objects with invalid parameters doesn’t crash Memgraph anymore, but throws an informative exception. [#819](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/819)
-  Error message warning about incompatible `epoch_id` between a MAIN and REPLICA instance has been improved. [#786](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/786)

## MAGE v1.6.0 - Jan 30, 2023

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- The `setup` script now halts if the build fails on C++ or Rust side. [#194](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/194)
- With the [`meta_util.schema()` procedure](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/meta_util), you can generate a graph schema as a graph result. [#187](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/187)
- The execution of the `single` method multiple times has been improved by rewriting [the distance calculator](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/distance_calculator) from Python to C++. [#191](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/191)
- [Dynamic graph analytics](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/betweenness_centrality_online) have been ported to C++ to improve performance. [#182](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/182)
- [New module `elastic_search_serialization`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/elasticsearch_synchronization) enables developers to serialize Memgraph into Elasticsearch instance using basic authentication. [#170](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/170)

## Memgraph v2.5.2 - Jan 26, 2023

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Variables can be used inside nested [FOREACH clauses](/querying/clauses). [#725](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/725)
- [FOREACH clause](/querying/clauses) can now use indexes if needed (e.g. in case of MERGE). [#736](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/736)
- [C++ API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api) now allows setting and getting node and relationship properties. [#732](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/732)
- [OPTIONAL MATCH](/querying/clauses/optional-match) can now use label property indexes that are referencing the previously matched variables. [#736](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/736)
- Iterating over all relationships in a graph now works as expected, as well as checking whether the graph contains a given relationship. [#743](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/743)
- Implementation of the [All Shortest Paths algorithm](/advanced-algorithms/built-in-graph-algorithms#all-shortest-paths) was fixed so the paths are no longer duplicated when the upper bound is used. [#737](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/737)

## MAGE v1.5.1 - Jan 20, 2023

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- The version of MemgraphDB that will be used in the Docker image has been updated to 2.5.1.
  [#193](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/193)

## Memgraph v2.5.1 - Jan 19, 2023

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- The LOAD CSV clause now uses less RAM to load a whole CSV file. Modification
  made to improve the LOAD CSV operation, also influenced high memory usage
  operations with objects such as lists and map. Modifying or accessing elements
  inside those objects now also uses less RAM.
  [#712](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/712)
- The logic of the `read_write_type_checker` was corrected so queries now get
  the right `rw_type`, making the replication system work as expected.
  [#709](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/709)
- Bolt protocol has been improved by adding the server-assigned query ID (`qid`)
  as part of the transactions' metadata.
  [#721](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/721)
- Fixed a trigger bug that would cause an error if Memgraph is configured to run
  without properties on edges. As a result of the fiy, triggers are now working
  as expected when there are no properties on edges.
  [#717](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/717)

## MAGE v1.5.0 - Dec 20, 2022

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Now you can find ancestors (all the nodes from which a path exists ) and descendants (all nodes to which a path exists) starting from a certain node, sort directed acyclic graph in a way that a node which appears before others is first, return a subgraph from nodes using `connect_nodes` method, and create relationships between nodes in a list using the `chain_nodes` method.
  [#180](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/180)
- C++ API is now aligned with Memgraph 2.5
  [#184](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/184)
- Graph Coloring no longer outputs strings but vertices and integers. This allows you to use the result of graph coloring directly in Memgraph Lab.
  [#177](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/177)

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}
- By enabling module reset, you can now train and evaluate the model without shutting down the database.
  Class labels can now start from 0 or negative numbers.
  The low limit of the early stopping flag no longer prematurely stops the training of the model while running the Node classification module.
  [#173](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/173)

## Memgraph v2.5.0 - Dec 13, 2022

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- `DISTINCT` operator can now be used with aggregation functions. Until now, if
  you wanted to use an aggregation function with distinct values, you had to
  write a query similar to this one `WITH DISTINCT n.prop as distinct_prop
  RETURN COUNT(distinct_prop)`. Now you can use the `DISTINCT` operator like in
  the following query, `RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n.prop)`.
  [#654](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/665)
- You can now create a user before the Bolt server starts using the environment
  variables `MEMGRAPH_USER` for the username, `MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD` for the
  password and `MEMGRAPH_PASSFILE` file that contains username and password for
  creating the user in the following format: `username:password`.
  [#696](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/696)
- With the new configuration flag `init_file` you can execute queries from the
  CYPHERL file which need to be executed before the Bolt server starts and with
  the configuration flag `init_data_file` you can execute queries from the
  CYPHERL file immediately after the Bolt server starts.
  [#696](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/696)

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Constructors and assignment operators in the C++ query modules API now work as
  expected, and the API type check in the `ValueNumeric` method now correctly
  recognizes numeric types.
  [#688](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/688)
- Error message support (`SetErrorMessage`) has been added to query methods that
  use the MAGE C++ API. [#688](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/688)
- The `EmptyResult` sink operator was added to the Memgraph's planner. This
means that results produced by a query `MATCH (n) SET n.test_prop = 2` will get
exhausted which was a problem in some Bolt clients implementations, e.g in
Golang's client. [#667](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/667)
- Fixed Python submodules reloading when calling `CALL mg.load()` and `CALL
  mg.load_all()`. Before, only the Python module would be reloaded, but now all
  dependencies get reloaded as well. This includes Python's utility submodules
  and Python packages, which means that the environment with Python packages can
  be changed without turning off the database.
  [#653](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/653)

## Lab v2.4.0 - Dec 2, 2022

{<h3> What's New </h3>}

* Memgraph Lab now supports manual transaction workflows you can construct using transaction commands `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
* Cypher intellisense has been updated to suggest new Cypher features from Memgraph 2.4.0 such as:
  * Privileges for user-role authorization.
  * Commands and privileges for label-based authorization.
  * Manual transaction commands: `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.
  * Checking configuration with `SHOW CONFIG`.
  * All shortest path algorithm `allShortest`.
  * Graph projection function `project`.
  * Additional query module signature that accepts a projected graph as an optional first argument.
* Graph results view will check for nodes and relationships in arrays and projected graphs. It simplifies
  the visualization of a projected graph or an array of nodes/relationships without using `UNWIND`.

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

* Once the table results view is selected, the results of the following query run will also preview in the table results view, instead of automatically switching to the graph view.
* Exploring a dataset's query collection now works as expected. It opens up a list of queries that can be used to explore the dataset.
* Failed queries from the rich collections now return a detailed error message.
* _Save code changes_ button in rich collections will now be enabled only if there are unsaved changes for the Cypher query
  or GSS.
* A bug that would only show the first node label instead of all node labels in the table results view has been fixed.

## MAGE v1.4.0 - Nov 15, 2022

  [#636](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/636)
- Fixed bug when getting iterating over in-edges of a Node.
  [#582](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/613)

## Lab v2.3.1 - Nov 4, 2022

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

* Writing a single-line comment in the Cypher code no longer results in an error.
* Having different map tiles (e.g. "light" map tile on one map view, but "dark" map tile on another map view) for multiple graph map views in the rich collection is enabled and works as expected.
* Graph rendering freeze when toggling the map view on/off during the graph rendering process has been fixed.
* All the information about nodes and edges on the graph schema is now previewed as expected.
* A bug that would mix query title and description when queries are reordered in the rich query collection has been fixed.
* A bug that would not reset the description field when adding a new query to the query collection has been fixed.
* Saving a new style now works as expected. The active style is saved, not the last applied one.

## Lab v2.3.0 - Oct 24, 2022

{<h3> What's New </h3>}

* Add new updates to the prepared datasets:
  * Add a search bar for searching and filtering datasets.
  * Add featured (highlighted) datasets.
  * Add rich collections with prepared queries, descriptions, and GSS for each dataset.
* Add new updates to the latest queries:
  * Change the name from "Latest queries" to "Run history" because it contains both queries and GSS changes.
  * Show GSS changes in the "Run history" section.
* Replace previous collections with "Rich collections":
  * Add more context to each collected query: title, markdown description, Cypher query, and GSS.
  * Add the ability to run multiple query executions within the query collection.
  * Add import and export functionality of a collection.
* Add a new version of GSS:
  * Add new GSS directive `@ViewStyle` to configure physics, link distance, repel force, and view type (`default` or `map`).
  * Add new GSS directive `@ViewStyle.Map` to configure map tiles for map view.
  * Add new GSS functions: `Slice`, `Split`, `Replace`, `Trim`, `Nodes`, `Edges`, `IsNumber`, `IsBoolean`, `IsString`, `IsNull`.
  * Add new GSS node properties `latitude` and `longitude` used to define the latitude and longitude of each node for the map view.
* Integrate graph visualization library `orb`.
* Add the ability to enable/disable map background view for nodes with geo information.
* Add the ability to connect to Neo4j, load datasets, and run Cypher queries.

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

* Fix map view to use latitude and longitude from GSS style instead of `lat` and `lng` node properties.
* Fix the default GSS to match new the map view configuration by checking `lat` and `lng` node properties.

## MAGE v1.3.2 - Oct 10, 2022

  in query modules. [#582](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/582)
- Fix a bug when changing role permissions for label based authorization, by
  passing user's instead of role's `fine_grained_access_handler`.
  [#579](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/579)

## Memgraph v2.4.0 - Sep 15, 2022

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Add replica state to `SHOW REPLICAS` query.
  [#379](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/379)
- Add `current_timestamp` and `number_of_timestamp_behind_master` to `SHOW
  REPLICAS` query. [#412](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/412)
- Query `REGISTER REPLICA replica_name SYNC` no longer supports `TIMEOUT`
  parameter. To mimic the previous behavior of `REGISTER REPLICA replica_name
  SYNC WITH TIMEOUT 1`, one should use `REGISTER REPLICA replica_name ASYNC`
  instead. [#423](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/423)
- Make behavior more [openCypher](http://opencypher.org/) compliant regarding
  checking against `NULL` values is `CASE` expressions.
  [#432](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/432)
- Previously registered replicas are automatically registered on restart of
  Memgraph. [#415](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/415)
- Add new command `SHOW CONFIG` that returns the configuration of the currently
  running Memgraph instance.
  [#459](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/459)
- Extend the shortest paths functionality with [All Shortest
  Path](/advanced-algorithms/built-in-graph-algorithms#all-shortest-paths)
  query. [#409](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/409)
- Extend the query modules C and Python API to enable logging on different
  levels. [#417](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/417)
- Added C++ query modules API. Instead of using the C API call, C++ API calls
  significantly simplify the implementation of fast query modules.
  [#546](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/546)
- [Enterprise] Added support for label-based authorization. In addition to
  clause-based authorization rules, each user can now be granted `NOTHING`,
  `READ`, `UPDATE`, or `CREATE_DELETE` permission on a given label or edge
  type. [#484](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/484)
- New Cypher function `project()` creates a projected graph consisting of nodes
  and edges from aggregated paths. Any query module or algorithm can be now run
  on a subgraph, by passing the variable of the projected graph as the first
  argument of the query module procedure. [#535](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/535)

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Added a check to ensure two replicas cannot be registered to an identical
  end-point. [#406](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/406)
- `toString` function is now able to accept `Date`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`
  and `Duration` data types.
  [#429](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/429)
- Aggregation functions now return the openCypher-compliant results on `null`
  input and display the correct behavior when grouped with other operators.
  [#448](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/448)
- Corrected inconsistencies and incorrect behavior with regards to sync
  replicas. For more detail about the behavior, please check [Under the
  hood view on replication](/configuration/replication).
  [#435](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/435)
- Fixed handling `ROUTE` Bolt message. Memgraph didn't handle the fields of
  `ROUTE` message properly. Therefore the session might be stuck in a state
  where even the `RESET` message did not help. With this fix, sending a `RESET`
  message will properly reset the session.
  [#475](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/475)

  `mg.create_module_file`, `mg.update_module_file`, `mg.delete_module_file`,
  `mg.get_module_file`, and `mg.get_module_files` allow you to do modifications
  on your Python module files, get their content, and list all the files present
  in your query module directories directly from Memgraph.
  [#330](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/330)
- Built-in procedures
  [`mg.procedures`](/custom-query-modules/manage-query-modules#utility-query-module) and
  [`mg.transformations`](/data-streams/transformation-modules#utility-procedures-for-transformations)
  return additional information about the procedures and transformations
  scripts. `path` returns an absolute path to the module file containing the
  procedure, while `is_editable` returns `true` if the file can be edited using
  Memgraph or `false` otherwise.
  [#310](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/310)
- [Added `SHOW VERSION` query](/configuration/server-stats) that returns the version of the Memgraph server
  which is being queried. [#265](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/265)

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

  module. This fixes a nondeterministic fatal Python error.
  [#320](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/320)
- Use correct error when printing warning in rebalance callback of Kafka
  consumer. [#321](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/321)

  Previously, a serialization error caused an exception to be thrown since
  nested transactions are not supported. After this fix, the transactions are
  handled correctly in the transaction retry logic.
  [#339](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/339)
- Temporal types `LocalTime` and `LocalDateTime` instantiations return subsecond
  precision. Additionally, query modules `mg_local_date_time_now()` and
  `mg_local_time_now()` also return subsecond precision.

## Memgraph v2.1.1 - Dec 07, 2021

<Callout type="error">

{<h3> Breaking Changes </h3>}

- Loading streams created by versions of Memgraph older than 2.1 is not
  possible. We suggest you extract the necessary information using the older
  version of Memgraph and recreate the streams in a newer version (Memgraph 2.1
  and newer).

</Callout>

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Added procedures for retrieving configuration information specific for each
  stream type. `mg.pulsar_stream_info` will return information about a specific
  Pulsar stream and `mg.kafka_stream_info` will return information about a
  specific Kafka stream. [#301](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/301)
- `SHOW STREAMS` now returns default values for batch interval and batch size if
  they weren't specified. [#306](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/306)

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Query execution stats, returned after a Cypher query was executed, are now
  updated with the changes made in write procedures.
  [#304](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/304)
- Loading streams created by older versions won't cause Memgraph to crash.
  [#302](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/302)

## Lab v1.3.6 - Dec 3, 2021

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

* Fix the bug when returning edges: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')`.

## Memgraph v2.1.0 - Nov 22, 2021

<Callout type="error">

{<h3> Breaking Changes </h3>}

- Loading streams created by older versions cause Memgraph to crash. The only
  possible workaround involves **deleting the existing streams**.
  The streams can be deleted by the `DROP STREAM` query in the old versions of
  Memgraph. After upgrading to this version, the `streams` directory has to be
  deleted manually from Memgraph's data directory (on Debian-based systems, it
  is `/var/lib/memgraph` by default).
- The query for creating a Kafka stream now requires the `KAFKA` keyword. The
  previous form `CREATE STREAM ...` was changed to `CREATE KAFKA STREAM ...`.

</Callout>

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Now supporting Bolt protocol version 4.3.
  [#226](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/226)
- Streams support for retrying conflicting transactions. When a message is
  processed from a certain stream source, a query is executed as a part of the
  transaction. If that transaction fails because of other conflicting
  transactions, the transaction is retried a set number of times. The number of
  retries and interval between each retry can be controlled with configs
  `--stream-transaction-conflict-retries` and
  `--stream-transaction-retry-interval`.
  [#294](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/294)
- Added procedure to configure the starting offset (to consume messages from) of
  a topic (and its partitions).
  [#282](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/282)
- Added `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` option to `CREATE KAFKA STREAM` which you can check
  [here](/data-streams).
  [#282](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/282)
- Added Bolt notifications in the query summary to inform the user about results
  or to give useful tips. When a query executes successfully, sometimes is
  necessary to give users tips or extra information about the execution.
  [#285](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/285)
- Added execution statistics in the query summary to inform user on how many
  objects were affected. E.g., when you run a query with a `CREATE` clause,
  you'll know how many nodes/edges were created by it.
  [#285](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/285)
- Added support for connecting to Pulsar as a new stream source. For more
  details, check out our [reference pages](/data-streams).
  [#293](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/293)

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Allow duration values to be used as weights in the [Weighted Shortest
  Path](/advanced-algorithms/built-in-graph-algorithms#weighted-shortest-path)
  query. [#278](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/278)
- Fix linkage error when `mgp_local_time_get_minute` is used.
  [#273](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/273)

  [v1.1.0](https://github.com/memgraph/mgconsole/releases/tag/v1.1.0).
  [#260](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/260)

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Graph updates made in the write procedures are now correctly registered in the
  triggers. [#262](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/262)
- Fixed `DETACH DELETE` interaction with the triggers. Previously, vertices
  deleted by the `DETACH DELETE` would not be registered by triggers if only `ON () DELETE` trigger existed.
  [#266](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/266)

## Memgraph v2.0.0 - Oct 5, 2021

<Callout type="error">

{<h3> Breaking Changes </h3>}

- Changed the `timestamp()` function to return `microseconds` instead of
  `milliseconds`.
- Most of the query modules C API functions are changed to return a `mgp_error`
  as a more fine-grained way of error reporting. The only exceptions are the
  functions that free allocated memory (`mgp_free` and `mgp_global_free`) and
  destroy objects (`mgp_value_destroy`, `mgp_list_destroy`, etc.) which
  remain the same.
- The first user created using the `CREATE USER` query will have all the
  privileges granted to him. Previously, you could've locked yourself out of
  Memgraph by creating a user and immediately disconnecting.

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Added support for temporal types, a feature that allows the user to manipulate
  and store time related data in the graph. For more information take a look at
  the [reference guide](/fundamentals/data-types)
- Added support for parameters with `CREATE` clause in the following form:
  `CREATE (n $param)`.
- Introduced settings to Memgraph that can be modified during runtime. You can
  check out more details [here](/configuration/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).
- Added writeable procedure support, so
  [procedures](/custom-query-modules/python/python-example)
  can modify the graph by creating and deleting vertices and edges, modifying
  the labels of vertices or setting the properties of vertices and edges.

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Fixed planning of queries with `MERGE` clause. If a previously defined symbol
  is used as property value inside the `MERGE` clause, the planner will
  correctly use the label-property index if present.
- Unused memory is correctly returned to OS when `FREE MEMORY` query is used.
  Before, Memgraph would free up the memory internally and not return it to the
  OS. Because of that Memgraph could allocate more memory from the OS than it's
  allowed.
- Fixed recovery from durability files. Because of a wrong check, Memgraph could
  crash and leave the durability files in an invalid state making recovery not
  possible.
- Fixed usage of `execute` keyword in queries. Because of the special way we
  handle the `EXECUTE` keyword from the `CREATE TRIGGER` query using that same
  keyword in other contexts caused Memgraph to crash.

## Lab v1.3.2 - Oct 5, 2021

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Fixed the copy to clipboard bug with removed spaces.
- Updated the Cypher IntelliSense with the latest commands.

## Lab v1.3.1 - Sep 27, 2021

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Signed the Memgraph Lab applications for macOS and Windows.

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Fixed the paste overwrite action in the query editor.
- Fixed the bug `Cannot read property 'class' of null`.

## Memgraph v1.6.1 - Jul 24, 2021

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Added proper privilege checks for queries executed by triggers and stream
  transformations.

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Fixed error handling in streams to make restarting streams possible after
  failing. The issue is caused by not rolling back the transaction in which the
  query failed, so when the stream was restarted and tried to process the next
  batch of messages it was still in a transaction, but it tried to start a new
  one. Now the transaction is rolled back in case of any errors during query
  execution, so a new transaction can be started during the processing of the
  next batch of messages.

## Memgraph v1.6.0 - Jul 7, 2021

<Callout type="error">

{<h3> Breaking Changes </h3>}

- Changed the `LOCK_PATH` permission to `DURABILITY`.

</Callout>

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Added support for consuming Kafka streams. You can connect Memgraph to a Kafka
  cluster and run queries based on the messages received. The transformation
  from Kafka to Cypher queries is done using **Transformation Modules**, a
  concept similar to Query Modules. Using our Python and C API, you can easily
  define functions that analyze Kafka messages and generate different queries
  based on them. The stream connection can be configured, tested, stopped,
  started, checked, and dropped.
- Introduced global allocators for Query Modules using C API, so the data can be
  preserved between multiple runs of the same procedure.
- Introduced new isolation levels, `READ COMMITTED` and `READ_UNCOMMITTED`. The
  isolation level can be set with a config. Also, you can set the isolation
  level for a certain session or the next transaction. The names of the
  isolation levels should be self-explanatory, unlike the `SNAPSHOT ISOLATION`
  which is still the default isolation level.
- The query timeouts are now triggered using a different method. Before, we used
  the TSC to measure the execution time. Unfortunately, this proved unreliable
  for certain CPUs (AMD Ryzen 7 and M1), which caused queries to timeout almost
  instantly. We switched to POSIX timer which **should** work on every hardware,
  while not affecting the performance.
- Added a config, `allow-load-csv`, with which you can disable `LOAD CSV`
  clause. `LOAD CSV` can read and display data from any file on the system which
  could be insecure for some systems. Because of that, we added a config that
  allows you to disable that clause in every case.
- Added `CREATE SNAPSHOT` query. Snapshots are created every few minutes, using
  this query you can trigger snapshot creation instantly.
- Increased the default query timeout to 10 minutes. The previous default amount
  of 3 minutes proved too small, especially for queries that use `LOAD CSV` with
  a large dataset.

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Fixed parsing of certain types in Query Modules using Python API.
- Fixed a concurrency bug for Query Modules using Python API. Running the same
  procedure from multiple clients caused the Memgraph instance to crash.
- Fixed restoring triggers that call procedures. Because the triggers were
  restored before the procedures, the query trigger executes couldn't find the
  called procedure, which caused the restore to fail. Switching up the order was
  enough to fix the problem.

## Memgraph v1.5.0 - May 28, 2021

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Added database triggers. You can now create, delete, and print out triggers
  that execute Cypher statements. You can create custom actions whenever a node
  or an edge is created, updated, or deleted. All the triggers are persisted on
  the disk, so no information is lost between runs.
- Replaced mg_client with the mgconsole command-line interface, which ships
  directly with Memgraph. You can now install mgconsole directly on Windows and
  macOS.

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Fixed parsing of types for Python procedures for types nested in `mgp. List`.
  For example, parsing of `mgp.List[mgp.Map]` works now.
- Fixed memory tracking issues. Some of the allocation and deallocation wasn't
  tracked during the query execution.
- Fixed reading CSV files that are using CRLF as the newline symbol.
- Fixed permission issues for `LOAD CSV`, `FREE MEMORY`, `LOCK DATA DIRECTORY`,
  and replication queries.

## Memgraph v1.4.0 - Apr 2, 2021

<Callout type="error">

{<h3> Breaking Changes </h3>}

- Changed `MEMORY LIMIT num (KB|MB)` clause in the procedure calls to `PROCEDURE MEMORY LIMIT num (KB|MB)`. The functionality is still the same.

</Callout>

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Added replication to community version.
- Added support for multiple query modules directories at the same time. You can
  now define multiple, comma-separated paths to directories from which the
  modules will be loaded using the `--query-modules-directory` flag.
- Added support for programatically reading in data from CSV files through the
  `LOAD CSV` clause. We support CSV files with and without a header, the
  supported dialect being Excel.
- Added a new flag `--memory-limit` which enables the user to set the maximum
  total amount of memory memgraph can allocate during its runtime.
- Added `FREE MEMORY` query which tries to free unusued memory chunks in
  different parts of storage.
- Added the memory limit and amount of currently allocated bytes in the result
  of `SHOW STORAGE INFO` query.
- Added `QUERY MEMORY LIMIT num (KB|MB)` to Cypher queries which allows you to
  limit memory allocation for the entire query. It can be added only at the end
  of the entire Cypher query.
- Added logs for the different parts of the recovery process. `INFO`, `DEBUG`
  and `TRACE` level all contain additional information that is printed out while
  the recovery is in progress.

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Fixed garbage collector by correctly marking the oldest current timestamp
  after the database was recovered using the durability files.
- Fixed reloading of the modules with changed result names.
- Fixed profile query to show the correct name of the ScanAll operator variant.

## Lab v1.3.0 - Feb 19, 2021

## Memgraph v1.3.0 - Jan 26, 2021

<Callout type="error">

{<h3> Breaking Changes </h3>}

- Added extra information in durability files to support replication, making it
  incompatible with the durability files generated by older versions of
  Memgraph. Even though the replication is an Enterprise feature, the files are
  compatible with the Community version.

</Callout>

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Added support for data replication across a cluster of Memgraph instances.
  Supported instance types are MAIN and REPLICA. Supported replication modes are
  SYNC (all SYNC REPLICAS have to receive data before the MAIN can commit the
  transaction), ASYNC (MAIN doesn't care if data is replicated), SYNC WITH
  TIMEOUT (MAIN will wait for REPLICAS within the given timeout period, after
  timout, replication isn't aborted but the replication demotes the REPLICA to
  the ASYNC mode).
- Added support for query type deduction. Possible query types are `r` (read),
  `w` (write), `rw` (read-write). The query type is returned as a part of the
  summary.
- Improved logging capabilities by introducing granular logging levels. Added
  new flag, `--log-level`, which specifies the minimum log level that will be
  printed. E.g., it's possible to print incoming queries or Bolt server states.
- Added ability to lock the storage data directory by executing the `LOCK DATA DIRECTORY` query which delays the deletion of the files contained in the
  data directory. The data directory can be unlocked again by executing the
  `UNLOCK DATA DIRECTORY` query.

## Lab v1.2.0 - Nov 3, 2020

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Added ability to create custom graph styling for nodes and edges in graph view
  with graph style language (similar to CSS).

- Set encrypted connection to be turned off by default on login screen (Memgraph
  v1.2.0 comes with SSL off by default).

{<h3> Bug Fixes </h3>}

- Added ability to hide graph view if there are no node/edge data in response.

## Memgraph v1.1.0 - Jul 1, 2020

{<h3> Major Features and Improvements </h3>}

- Properties in nodes and edges are now stored encoded and compressed. This
  change significantly reduces memory usage. Depending on the specific dataset,
  total memory usage can be reduced up to 50%.
- Added support for rescanning query modules. Previously, the query modules
  directory was scanned only upon startup. Now it is scanned each time the user
  requests to load a query module. The functions used to load the query modules
  were renamed to `mg.load()` and `mg.load_all()` (from `mg.reload()` and
  `mg.reload_all()`).
- Improved execution performance of queries that have an IN list filter by using
  label+property indexes. Example: `MATCH (n: Label) WHERE n.property IN [] ...`

- Added support for `ANY` and `NONE` openCypher functions. Previously, only
  `ALL` and `SINGLE` functions were implemented.

{<h3> Bug Fixes and Other Changes </h3>}

- Fixed invalid paths returned by variable expansion when the starting node and
  destination node used the same symbol. Example: `MATCH path = (n: Person {name: "John"})-[: KNOWS*]->(n) RETURN path`

- Improved semantics of `ALL` and `SINGLE` functions to be consistent with
  openCypher when handling lists with `Null` s.
- `SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO` now returns property names as a list for unique
  constraints.
- Escaped label/property/edgetype names in `DUMP DATABASE` to support names with
  spaces in them.
- Fixed handling of `DUMP DATABASE` queries in multi-command transactions (
  `BEGIN`, ..., `COMMIT`).
- Fixed handling of various query types in explicit transactions. For example,
  constraints were allowed to be created in multi-command transactions (`BEGIN`
  , ..., `COMMIT`) but that isn't a transactional operation and as such can't
  be allowed in multi-command transactions.
- Fixed integer overflow bugs in `COUNT`, `LIMIT` and `SKIP`.
- Fixed integer overflow bugs in weighted shortest path expansions.
- Fixed various other integer overflow bugs in query execution.
- Added Marvel Comic Universe tutorial.
- Added FootballTransfers tutorial.
