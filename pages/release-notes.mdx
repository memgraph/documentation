## üö® Important updates

New releases might affect your existing code, queries or configuration.
Ensure they're updated to align with the latest updates and changes.

<Callout type="info">
To ensure compatibility and stability, we urge you to **recompile your modules
with each Memgraph update**. While an old build might still work, skipping
recompilation could lead to unexpected crashes ‚Äî better to be safe than
troubleshoot in production.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Link prediction, node classification, and the text module, which were temporarily removed in MAGE v1.14.0, are available again from v1.22.0 onward.**
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Memgraph Platform image is no longer supported**

Starting with version 2.15, Memgraph Platform transitions to a multi-container
application. This upgrade moves from a single Docker image to separate
containers for Memgraph+MAGE and Memgraph Lab, utilizing Docker Compose for
deployment and management.

For detailed setup instructions and best practices, please refer to the [Docker
Compose documentation for Memgraph
Platform](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker-compose#docker-compose-for-memgraph-platform).

Please note that the [Memgraph Platform Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/memgraph/memgraph-platform) is no longer being
updated.
</Callout>

## üöÄ Latest release

### Memgraph v3.3.0 - June 4th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- New bolt work scheduler based on a priority queue with a sidecar channel for
  high priority queries. Users should never see a blocked database due to heavy
  load. Users can now run specific high priority queries even under heavy loads
  (example: SHOW TRANSACTIONS).
  [2567](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2567)
- Added support for creating indices on nested properties within maps. Users
  can now create efficient indices on deeply nested data structures using dot
  notation, such as `CREATE INDEX ON :User(preferences.notifications.email)`,
  eliminating the need to flatten complex nested properties for query
  performance.** [#2934](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2934)
- Establishing the connection between sockets now has a timeout of 5s. Users
  can expect lower and more predictable p99 latencies for the time needed to
  establish a socket connection. The timeout for StateCheckRpc and
  FrequentHeartbeatRpc is reduced to 5s. This will help heartbeat mechanisms to
  figure out faster when the instance is down or when some steps need to be
  taken to bring replica to the same level on which the main is.
  [#2949](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2949)
- Memgraph now exposes a new set of metrics on HA cluster: how long the data
  failover takes and how long starting and finalising transaction takes on
  replica instances. [#2965](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2965)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- Updated `PropertyValue` structure to use PropertyId keys for improved
  performance, reduced memory usage, and simplified handling. Introduced
  `ExternalPropertyValue` type with string-keyed map for human-readable
  property names in parsing/serialization contexts.
  [#2901](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2901)
- Added daily build of `RelWithDebInfo` Docker image for `arm64`. Allows ARM
  users to debug bleeding edge Memgraph builds.
  [#2996](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2996)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Fixed memory leaks in several C++ API functions, including those related to
  vector search, text search, index management, and constraints.**
  [#2934](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2934)
- TTL, streams and CSV import could fail when using auth modules. When using
  auth modules, we require a user/role. In these specific cases we want an
  empty user, which fails on creation. Users can now use stream, TTL and init
  from cypher file with auth modules.
  [2967](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2967)
- `utils::Scheduler` wouldn't use strict increments when tasks took longer than
  the period. This would cause the start time to drift. Users could have seen
  this when running TTL on v3.2. Now the start time will be respected. In cases
  where tasks take longer, the next execution will be immediate, but subsequent
  will follow the schedule.
  [2970](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2970)
- The asynchronous replication is improved for situations in which the recovery
  task would've finished while another transaction is getting replicated.
  Previously, such transaction would never get replicated on async replica
  which wasn't the intended
  behaviour.[#2973](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2973)
- When an instance becomes main, it marks a range of transactions with IDs
  smaller than global timestamp used in replication as finished. This should
  ensure consistent memory behaviour both on main and replicas. In the same
  way, transactions will be also marked finished when SnapshotRpc is received
  or when the `RECOVER SNAPSHOT` query is used on the standalone Memgraph.
  [#2976](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2976)
- Tasks for checking replica state and recovery task can now be skipped if it
  is impossible to get unique access to RPC lock for ASYNC replicas. This is to
  ensure that the commit task executes as soon as possible so that the deadlock
  between commit and recover tasks cannot happen anymore. There are no UX-wise
  changes but users can expect more reliable ASYNC replication.
  [#2984](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2984)
- Main instance won't block while trying to acquire RPC stream for replicating
  txn to ASYNC replica. It will instead consider replica as maybe behind. User
  can expect deadlock-free behavior when using ASYNC replica. Commits will
  happen faster while the replication lag will be a bit bigger.
  [#2989](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2989)
- Made parallel snapshot more flexible while combining temporary file into a
  single snapshot. Users are now less restricted on the batch size they can
  use. [2995](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2995)
- Fixed queries using `WHERE ... IN` clauses no longer return an empty results
  set when using label+property indices.
  [#3014](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/3014)
- Fixed memory leak that occurred when queries updated deeply nested
  properties. Users can now safely create queries that update nested map
  properties without risk of eventual out-of-memory errors.
  [#3016](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/3016)

### MAGE v3.3.0 - June 4th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- Upgrade torch version to 2.6 to address [this
  vulnerability](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security/advisories/GHSA-53q9-r3pm-6pq6).
  [#614](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/614)

### Lab v3.3.0 - June 4th, 2025

<LabReleasesClient version="3.3.0" />

## Previous releases

### Memgraph v3.2.1 - May 9th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- Modified the Docker image such that the `memgraph` user has the UID `101` to
  match that used by `MAGE`. If the user has any volumes mounted on older
  versions or memgraph (< 3.2.1), then they should `chown 101:101
  /path/to/volume` to allow the `memgraph` user to read and write to them.
  [#2947](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2947)
- New `relwithdebinfo` Docker build for `arm64` to allow users to debug
  Memgraph on ARM. Push `relwithdebinfo` DEB packages and Docker images to
  download bucket during release, so they are available
  [here](https://memgraph.com/download)
  [#2952](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2952)
- Improved the performance when writing to disk log stores' durable data using
  batched writing. Users can expect the same behavior as before, with a
  slightly better performance when using high availability.
  [#2946](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2946)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Fixed `PageSlabMemoryResource` large allocation returning wrong address.
  Creating deltas with large properties would correctly allocate memory, but
  cause an out-of-bounds write. Users shouldn't see segfaults on commits or GC
  runs anymore. [#2950](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2950)
- Fixed CallProcedureCursor reset method. Query modules would sometimes cause a
  crash due to not being reset properly.
  [#2953](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2953)
- Fixed impersonate user misalignment between interpreter and session. This
  broke the permissions when using the impersonated user. User can now actually
  use the feature and see the correct behavior.
  [#2938](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2938)
- Fixed query type deduction giving the wrong answer in cases where subqueries
  execute read procedures. Without the fix users could not execute certain
  queries. Query type misalignment shouldn't occur anymore.
  [#2944](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2944)
- Improved usages of read-modify-write pattern in the Raft code by using compare
  exchange operations instead of blindly loading, modifying and then storing
  again. Users should expect the same behaviour from the perspective of
  correctness but with a smaller chance of something getting inconsistent.
  [#2937](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2937)

### Memgraph v3.2.0 - Apr 23rd, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes</h4>}

- Procedure results are now populated with null values by default. Procedures
  no longer throw if all result fields don't get inserted; instead, they return
  null in those fields. [#2790](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2790)

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- Added support for composite indices. Composite indices are indices on labels
  and two or more properties. Composite indices significantly improve database
  performance on queries that filter against multiple properties. To take
  advantage of this improvement, users should create composite indices for
  frequently queried combinations of properties.
  [#2760](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2760),
  [#2887](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2887)
- Added metrics tracking related to replication and high availability. This
  includes metrics like the number of RPC messages sent, the duration of the
  recovery etc. Users can use our
  [prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/memgraph/prometheus-exporter) to get
  immediately cluster info status.
  [#2772](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2772)
- Added `mgp_result_reserve` function to the C-api for reserving memory for
  procedure results. [#2790](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2790)
- Added edge TTL. The system can now automatically delete stale edges using the
  specified property `ttl` inside the edges.
  [#2730](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2730)
- Added global index on edge properties. Since edges have only one relationship
  type, the global property index will have a data structure that is tracked
  over properties with the syntax `CREATE GLOBAL EDGE INDEX ON :(prop)`.
  [#2730](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2730)
- Expanded storage access types to UNIQUE, READ, WRITE and READ_ONLY. A better
  differentiation of query types allows more queries to run in parallel. Users
  can now run read queries while creating snapshots, even in ANALYTICAL mode.
  [2798](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2798)
- Added support for OR label expressions, enabling queries like `MATCH
  (n:Label1|Label2)` to retrieve nodes with any of the specified labels. If
  indexes exist on the labels, the planner rewrites the query as a UNION of
  index scans for efficient execution. Additionally, simple WHERE clauses with
  OR label checks are optimized similarly, reducing reliance on full scans.
  [#2783](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2783)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- There is now an improved logic for selecting the new MAIN instance during the
  failover in the MT environment. An instance that has the newest databases is
  considered the newest. Users will now have a smaller chance of experiencing
  the loss of committed data.
  [#2812](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2812)
- Metrics related to HA coordinators are now immediately reset after the client
  pulls them. Users can now see the aggregated value from all coordinators when
  using [Memgraph's Prometheus
  exporter](https://github.com/memgraph/prometheus-exporter/pull/19). Also, the
  data won't be lost after the coordinator's restart.
  [#2802](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2802)
- The memory footprint of TypedValue (internal data structure used mostly
  during query execution) got smaller. The optimization results in lower memory
  usage in query modules that return many results (e.g., modules that return
  the whole graph, like PageRank) by a few percent.
  [#2806](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2806)
- Reduced memory footprint of `mgp_result_record` used for returning results in
  all procedures APIs. The optimization reduces memory usage by up to 50% in
  query modules, which return many results, such as the whole graph (e.g.,
  PageRank). [#2790](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2790)
- `utils::Scheduler` now skips backed-up tasks. Background tasks that took
  longer than the period will not be called multiple times after the execution.
  It lowers the overall workload and frees up resources.
  [2853](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2853)
- Schema info edge updates made faster. Previously, edge deletions would cause
  a slow commit. Users can now use the run-time schema info more freely without
  impacting the performance.
  [2844](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2844)
- Snapshot creation has been parallelized. Edges and vertices are batched (as
  defined via flag). These batches are processed in parallel on a number of
  threads. Users can now create snapshots in less time, freeing up resources
  for other tasks. [2818](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2818)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Parsing a query in which a pattern comprehension is nested (such as `RETURN
  [[(x)-->(y) | x]];`) no longer causes a crash.
  [#2716](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2716)
- Replica won't crash anymore when performing recovery and when disk access to
  the durability folder fails. Instead, it will return an empty response,
  signaling the main that the recovery isn't completed. Users should expect the
  same behavior as before.
  [#2780](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2780)
- The scheduler (utility module) will release its lock before starting to
  execute its function. This will enable deadlock-free concurrent execution
  between the periodic snapshot thread and the thread that performs demotion
  under replication. [#2882](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2882)
- During the promotion of the MAIN instance, the promotion will be aborted if
  registering one of the replicas fails. In that case, the coordinator will
  retry the promotion after a few seconds. There is now a smaller chance of
  users experiencing failed failover. Previously, the RPC communication would
  fail, and MAIN would partially register some of the replicas.
  [#2869](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2869)
- The newly elected coordinator leader will perform a failover correctly when
  the leader inherits the cluster state without the main instance.
  [#2857](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2857)
- When manually promoting an instance, it is now unnecessary that all replicas
  are alive. Users can now use the `SET INSTANCE instance TO MAIN` query in
  more situations. [#2857](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2857)
- If a snapshot gets created while MAIN receives a request to demote itself to
  REPLICA, the snapshot creation will get aborted. Additionally, the thread
  creating snapshots will be paused on demotion. Similarly, when the REPLICA is
  promoted to the main, the snapshot thread will be resumed.
  [#2846](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2846)
- The `DUMP DATABASE` query generated the wrong query for ANY triggers. Dumping
  the database now generates the correct trigger query.
  [2855](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2855)
- Fixed missing edge property index and unique constraint garbage collection.
  No slow memory creep up while using constraints or edge index.
  [2850](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2850)
- Metadata from WAL files was unnecessarily used during recovery, even for old
  WAL files which shouldn't have been used. This could've caused a possible
  data loss because newer WAL files wouldn't be used in some situations while
  recovering. [#2892](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2892)
- `DUMP DATABASE` has more stability guarantees. The output order has changed
  for better memory usage and performance, and a sort is applied to the type
  constraints. The durability write bug in v2.19.0, v2.20.0, v2.20.1 for the
  3D Cartesian data type was fixed in v2.21.0, but in a way that reading
  durability from those versions would no longer be possible if a "corrupt"
  3D Cartesian was written into those durability files. Those durability
  files can now be read, and the engine handles the "corrupt" values.
  [#2888](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2888)
- Fixed unreliable authentication deserialization. Users can now reliably
  upgrade auth data between different versions, as well as between the
  community and enterprise.
  [2915](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2915)

### MAGE v3.2.0 - Apr 23rd, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes</h4>}

- Significantly improved image build time and size -> there is only "with-ML"
  image now -> please use that one instead of previous no-ML images.
  [#590](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/590)
- Shorten Docker image tags e.g. from `3.2-memgraph-3.2` -> `3.2` or
  `3.2-memgraph-3.2-relwithdebinfo` -> `3.2-relwithdebinfo` for all future
  releases. Users updating to images for Memgraph/MAGE >= 3.2 should use the
  shorter tag format. [#600](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/600)

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- Added migration module via the Arrow Flight RPC protocol. Users can now
  stream data into Memgraph using a single Cypher query by executing the `CALL
  migrate.arrow_flight()` procedure.
  [#558](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/558)
- Added migration module using `DuckDB`. Users can now connect to their data
  sources with DuckDB using a single Cypher query by executing the `CALL
  migrate.duckdb()` procedure.
  [#560](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/560)
- Added the migration module from another Memgraph instance. Users can now
  seamlessly transfer data from one Memgraph instance to another using a single
  Cypher query by executing the `CALL migrate.memgraph()` procedure.
  [#561](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/561)
- Added migration module to migrate from `ServiceNow` data source. Users can
  now migrate their data using ServiceNow REST API by executing a single Cypher
  query with `CALL migrate.servicenow()` procedure
  [#572](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/572)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- The performance of the betweenness centrality and online betweenness
  centrality algorithms has been improved, with speedups exceeding 100% in some
  cases. By default, the algorithm now uses half of the available hardware
  threads for parallelization.
  [#588](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/588)
- Updated torch versions to 2.4.0 to fix
  [CVE-2024-7804](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4vmg-rw8f-92f9); use
  cached Python packages for faster CI builds.
  [#587](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/587)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Moved `$HOME` for `memgraph` user to fix missing Python modules when users
  mount `/var/lib/memgraph` as an external volume.
  [#594](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/594)

### Lab v3.2.0 - Apr 23rd, 2025


<LabReleasesClient version="3.2.0" />


### Memgraph v3.1.1 - Mar 28th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- Added list comprehension Cypher feature. It's now possible to execute queries
  like `MATCH (x) RETURN [(x)-->(y) | y.prop];`.
  [#2656](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2656)
- Added `--storage-access-timeout-sec` flag. Previously the access timeout was
  hardcoded to 1sec. Now users can define an appropriate timeout for their
  workflow at startup. [#2831](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2831)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- Added OIDC SSO quality of life change. Previously, the first role from the
  roles field would always get picked even if it wasn't in the mappings. Allow
  multiple roles to be present in the roles field, but only if all those are in
  role mappings and mapped to the same Memgraph role.
  [#2799](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2799)
- Allow redirecting to nonlocalhost and HTTPS in SAML SSO. `CALLBACK_URL` can
  now use HTTPS and isn't hardcoded to the localhost.
  [#2799](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2799)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Timeout for `SwapMainUUIDRpc` message is now properly configured with the
  default value set to 10s. Users shouldn't expect any difference in the
  replication behavior. [#2826](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2826)
- Install correct SAML dependencies under MAGE. SAML SSO should now work
  correctly MAGE. [#2829](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2829)
- `EnableWritingOnMainRpc` will now be sent when the failover occurs, even if
  the network identity of some of the replicas isn't stable. Users will now be
  able to test HA in a docker-compose environment.
  [#2817](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2817)
- Fixed deadlock caused by write queries and periodic snapshots.
  [2819](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2819)
- Broken migration from old durable auth data. Migration is now fixed, and
  pre-v3.1 auth data can be correctly read. Users can upgrade to v3.1 without
  encountering authentication problems.
  [2820](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2820)
- RPC timeouts for messages requesting promotion, demotion, enabling writing on
  main and databases' history will now work correctly. Users shouldn't observe
  long-running RPCs in their HA environment anymore.
  [#2813](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2813)
- Memgraph DB doesn't know how it will get deployed on K8s. It is possible to
  abstract multiple coordinators under the same load balancer. In that case,
  the Bolt server is the same for all coordinators. Previously, the code didn't
  allow adding multiple coordinators with the same Bolt server. Now, the users
  will be able to do that.
  [#2801](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2801)
- Fix the segfault issue caused by a double free. It only happens when Python
  procedures are called in IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL mode.
  [#2804](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2804)
- The serialization reader would throw if data from the buffer weren't fully
  ready. That caused network connections between the main and replica to be
  constantly dying. Now, when the replica doesn't read all data from the
  buffer, the exception thrown in the SLK part of the code is handled properly,
  avoiding the connection drop. Additionally, the PR tries to reduce the
  massive amount of logs produced in HA code when trace log level is used.
  [#2770](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2770)
- `SnapshotRpc`, `WalFilesRpc`, and `CurrentWalRpc` will now wait for a main
  lock but for a maximum time of 30s. If the lock cannot be acquired within the
  30s on the replica, the main try to replicate again after a few seconds. Such
  timeout is added to prevent a possible deadlock when multiple fast failovers
  happen during transaction execution while the recovery process is in place.
  Users should observe the same behavior as before.
  [#2816](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2816)

### MAGE v3.1.1 - Mar 28th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- Added migration module from Neo4j. Users can now seamlessly insert data by
  using one single Cypher query to migrate their data from Neo4j. Query is
  performed with the `CALL migrate.neo4j()` procedure
  [#557](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/557)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- Added `gdb` to and full MAGE repo source to the RelWithDebInfo Docker image.
  This will allow for debugging instances without requiring a connection to the
  internet [#579](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/579)
- Reduced image size by cleaning up after installing packages.
  [#568](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/568),
  [#564](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/564)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Set default shell for `memgraph` user to `/bin/bash` for consistency with all
  previous Docker images. This should not change anything from the user's
  perspective [#577](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/577)
- The `export_util` query module didn't specify the export encoding. If your
  data had special characters not supported by ASCII, they would be saved as
  garbage in the exported file, or the export would fail.  We have fixed this
  by predefining the UTF-8 encoding in the export utility to support special
  characters [#554](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/554)

### Memgraph v3.1.0 - Mar 12th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes</h4>}

- Improved error messages might result in a `breaking` outcome under your
  applications if the application assumes the exact content of error messages.
  [#2379](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2379)
- `include/mg_exceptions.hpp` had ABI break which requires C++ modules to be
  rebuilt. [#2702](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2702)

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- Added toSet() function for removing duplicates from a list. The ordering of
  the list items is not preserved. This extension enables users to have more
  manipulation over List item objects in the query planner. Users can call the
  toSet(list) if they need to remove any duplicate values from the list.
  [#2659](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2659)
- Add custom authentication scheme for using OIDC Single Sign-On. Any OIDC
  scheme that exposes a public key for validating tokens using RSA is supported
  using Neo4j drivers. [#2715](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2715)
- Enterprise Feature: Impersonate User. Allows the user to impersonate a
  different user while executing queries. Users or roles with the correct
  permissions can define the target user for a session and execute queries as
  if the target user was logged in.
  [#2742](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2742)
- `project()` can now project a subgraph from lists of nodes and relationships,
  rather than just from paths. This relaxes the required format of query
  results needed to create subgraphs for further processing, or to pass to
  query modules. Users can build a subgraph from nodes and relationships which
  are computed separately, or come from different parts of your query, making
  queries cleaner, more performant, and easier to maintain.
  [#2611](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2611)
- Added mgp_list_reserve (C API) and List::Reserve (C++ API). Allows for more
  memory efficient list population under query modules.
  [#2650](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2650)
- Added query `SHOW VECTOR INDEX INFO` to display information about vector
  indices in a Cypher-like way. Although there is also a `CALL
  vector_search.show_index_info() YIELD * RETURN *`, the query was added to
  increase simplicity. The information can not be added to the `SHOW INDEX
  INFO` query because vector indices have additional information like
  dimension, size, capacity, and metric, so a different organization of records
  was needed. [#2757](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2757)
- Added functionality to assign multiple dynamic labels for a node from a
  variable or parameter. Users can now put dynamic label parameters in maps and
  assign labels like in the example `WITH {my_labels: ["Label1", "Label2"]} as
  x CREATE (n:x.my_labels). The result of the query is a node with 2 labels
  assigned from the list.`
  [#2713](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2713)
- Added support for dynamic relationship creation. Users can now create
  relationship types based on variable values. Example: `WITH {my_edge_type:
  "KNOWS"} as x CREATE ()-[:x.my_edge_type]->();` The result of this query
  would be a created triplet with the relationship type `KNOWS`.
  [#2558](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2558)
- Added the `length` function, which outputs the number of relationships in a
  given path object in the query or the number of elements in a list. The
  `length` function is identical to the already existing `size` function
  [#2681](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2681)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- Optimise `EdgeAccessor::IsVisible` such that connectivity check is only done
  when --storage-properties-on-edges=false. This gives better performance over
  queries involving edges.
  [#2769](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2769)
- Added fast retrieval of approximate vertex and edge counts in the C API with
  `mgp_graph_approximate_vertex_count` and `mgp_graph_approximate_edge_count`.
  Users can now use these functions to optimize certain data structures more
  efficiently. For example, they can use this information to preallocate memory
  for `std::vector`. [#2762](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2762)
- The timeout is added to the SnapshotRpc message. A replica will now update
  the main on its progress when applying the snapshot received as part of the
  recovery process. [#2701](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2701)
- The timeout is added to the following RPC messages: AppendDeltasRpc,
  WalFilesRpc and CurrentWalRpc. The replica will now, for every 100k processed
  deltas, send the RPC message saying that the progress is made. Main will wait
  for at most 30s for the replica reply, after which it will drop the
  connection. [#2690](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2690)
- SHOW REPLICAS query uses a best estimation of the REPLICA's state instead of
  querying the REPLICA for its current state. The SHOW REPLICAS query now
  returns immediately, as it does not need to wait for the REPLICA response.
  This means the query is lightweight, and users can query it more frequently.
  [#2679](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2679)
- Improved error messages that get sent to the user in cases of query failure.
  Better understanding of the issue that caused a query to fail and easier
  debugging. Better error messages also improve final results when in an AI
  pipeline. [#2379](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2379)
- SHOW/USE DATABASE reclassified as a non-system query. Multiple such queries
  can be executed in parallel. Since the queries do not require unique access
  anymore, users can execute them much more frequently and without impacting
  performance. [#2674](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2674)
- Add diagnostic flag `--debug-query-plans` to help see all generated plans and
  their costs. Fixed filter's cost estimate and other small cost estimator
  changes. Performance improvement for index iteration. Together, they help
  provide better plans/diagnostics around plans/performance on using indexes.
  [#2722](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2722)
- Performance improvement around calling of query modules, less work is
  performed setting up and moving around values.
  [#2640](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2640)
- Performance fix. Reduced contention by ensuring batch payloads were send to
  sockets. Performance is now better when returning many small rows.
  [#2667](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2667)
- SystemRecoveryRPC message will now be configured with a 5min timeout.
  Recovering 1000 tenants on replica takes approximately 25s so the 5min
  timeout should cover all cases successfully. Users shouldn't observe a
  different behavior compared to the before.
  [#2654](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2654)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- When a failover is done on the replica which doesn't contain all commits as
  the old main, ForceResetRpc won't be sent anymore to the old main (now
  replica). Instead, the new main will handle the old main (now replica)'s
  history through recovery. The old main's durability files will be saved
  inside the .old directory (data_directory/snapshots and data_directory/wals)
  so that admins can always recover the newer state if needed.
  [#2727](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2727)
- When started in a single-tenant mode, hidden files won't be symlinked in a
  default database directory anymore. This should enable people to use Memgraph
  in K8s with various storage systems under the hood.
  [#2748](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2748)
- Vector index will now correctly index only vertices with the desired label
  for indexing in the dataset where there exist vertices with different labels
  but with the shared property used for indexing.
  [#2701](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2701)
- Coordinators will not deadlock anymore when the user requests unregistration
  of data instances. At the moment of unregistration, the cluster now needs to
  have alive main instance so that the success of the requested unregistration
  operation can be guaranteed.
  [#2735](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2735)
- Fixed a segmentation fault that could occur in certain scenarios when parsing
  the vector index configuration map during vector index creation.
  [#2720](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2720)
- Misaligned snapshot and wal timestamps cause data loss. Replication via
  snapshot and wals could lead to data loss due to misaligned timestamps.
  [#2697](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2697)
- Queries that access storage can now timeout if storage access cannot be
  granted. Fixes potential deadlock under heavy load. Users could see a new
  error, the access timeout. In such cases, they can retry later on or make
  sure there are no conflicting queries.
  [#2561](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2651)
- The action for unregistering the replication instance wasn't durable before,
  so after restarting the coordinator instance, the replication instance would
  be observed again. [#2673](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2673)
- Parallel recovery didn't work with WAL files. Index and constraints recovery
  would use data batches calculated from the snapshot data. This would lead to
  a failure if the snapshot is not present or partial recovery if the snapshot
  and WALs were present. Users can now recover all data correctly and in
  parallel. [#2658](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2658)
- If finding steps needed to recover a replica fail, the database won't be
  crashed. The replica will remain in MAYBE_BEHIND state and get recovered
  later. [#2639](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2639)
- Resolved issues with reloading `numpy` and `dgl` modules, which could cause
  unexpected behavior when loaded multiple times. This fix ensures
  compatibility with the latest versions of these packages.
  [#2638](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2638)
- Query planner fixed to handle matching multiple paths whose symbols were
  already matched. This avoids a crash on queries of the type `MATCH (n0:N)
  OPTIONAL MATCH p0 = (n0), p1 = (n0) RETURN *;`, i.e., those with multiple
  paths using the same already matched variable, such as `n0` in the given
  example. Such queries can now be run safely.
  [#2692](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2692)
- Query modules can now handle returning error message even when we have hit
  memory limits. We no longer terminate when trying to copying a small string
  during mgp_func_result_set_error_msg. This means we are now more robust which
  using `--memory-limit`.
  [#2702](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2702)
- Bugfix for subtle data race around concurrent find+remove, there was a rare
  possibility of data integrity failure that would allow multiple unique
  entries. [#2686](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2686)
- Fix memory leak in C++ API and in `convert.str2object`.
  [#2643](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2643)
- The action for unregistering the replication instance wasn't durable, so
  after restarting the coordinator instance, the replication instance would be
  observed again. [#2673](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2673)
- Added yielding to reader-writer locks on ARM64. This improves efficiency and
  power consumption on contented locks on machines running on the ARM64
  chipset. Users can make better use of processing resources with highly
  contented databases running on such machines.
  [#2666](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2666)
- Fix occasional system flakiness caused by overly optimistic memory ordering
  in `RWSpinLock`. On machines with a weak memory model (such as ARM64), this
  may occasionally have caused reads of stale data between threads. Users can
  now expect the same correct behavior consistently on all architectures.
  [#2668](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2668)
- Temporal functions `date()`, `localtime()`, `localdatetime()` and
  `datetime()` now accept and convert any compatible time formats. Users can
  create queries that compare different temporal types and convert between
  temporal formats. [#2630](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2630)
- ForceResetStorageRPC message is now configured with the timeout of 60''.
  SystemHeartbeatRPC message is now configured with the timeout of 10''. If a
  replica cannot read epoch id, the database won't crash anymore. Users
  shouldn't see any different behavior compared to the before.
  [#2648](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2648)
- Rewritten query planning when using Edge indexing inside Optional. Query plan
  will prefer to expand from existing nodes rather than use a new edge index to
  scan over new relationships
  [#2741](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2741)
- Type checking added for vector search module. There was a bug where a user
  could provide any value, which would be translated into a list of zero
  values. Now, the supported type is a list of integer and double values. Not
  providing this value will result in an exception
  [#2759](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2759)

### MAGE v3.1.0 - Mar 12th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- Added migration from Amazon S3 CSV files. Users can now perform `CALL
  migrate.s3() YIELD row` syntax in order to populate their data directly from
  S3 [#547](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/547)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- The base Docker image has been switched from Debian 11 to Ubuntu 24.04 to
  ensure compatibility with toolchain-v6 and long-term security support.
  [535](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/535)
- Improve static PageRank algorithm. It is now roughly 3 times faster, and it
  uses 10%-15% less memory. Additionally, it now contains an argument to set
  the number of threads used. [#552](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/552)
- Improved Louvain community detection performance and reduced memory usage. A
  configuration option was added to control the number of threads used in the
  algorithm's parallelized sections. Introduced support for aborting the
  algorithm when Memgraph terminates the query using the module.
  [#549](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/549)

### Lab v3.1.0 - Mar 12th, 2025

<LabReleasesClient version="3.1.0" />

### Memgraph v3.0.0 - Jan 29th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes</h4>}

- Vector search has been removed from the experimental feature set. The API has
  changed and it's stable now.
  [#2500](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2500)
- Query modules memory allocator changed. Fixing an issue where query modules
  would incorrectly take up all memory due to the constant creation and
  deletion of objects. Add a reference type to CPP API, which should increase
  performance in some cases, and make minor changes to CPP API.
  [#2561](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2561)
- Always use durable storage under the high availability setup for coordinator
  data. From now on, HA will always use durable storage for all NuRaft data.
  The `--ha-durability` flag has been removed.
  [#2603](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2603)
- Remove `EdgeSetFrom`, `EdgeSetTo`, `EdgeChangeType` from the query modules
  API. These have been deemed low value and add extra complexity to other parts
  of the code base. It is essential that an edge during its lifetime is only
  ever owned by the same vertices as when the edge was created. This is
  important for the correct handling of edges. Among other things, indexing and
  edge deletion require that the edge's type, source and destination are
  invariant. [#2530](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2530)
- Fixed client-side routing in Kubernetes high availability deployment
  scenario. Memgraph now correctly supports client-side routing inside the
  Kubernetes environment.
  [#2568](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2568)

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- Added support for the exponentiation operator (^) in queries. Now, you can go
  even crazier with your math expressions under Cypher.
  [#2597](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2597)
- Added Cypher `toStringOrNull` function. It's practical because some data
  types are not working with `toString`. So instead of evaluating if `toString`
  could be used on a given type, it's possible to just use `toStringOrNull`
  function. [#2587](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2587)
- Added SHOW LICENSE INFO query to display a more granular view of what's the
  status with the license.
  [#2555](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2555)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- Dynamic graph algorithms are improved and moved under the Enterprise
  offering. [#2629](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2629)
- Implemented slight performance improvement under the Bolt network stack by
  only using poll if timeout is needed.
  [#2632](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2632)
- Implemented many improvements under the replication recovery process.
  [#2617](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2617)
- Updated Python libraries under the Docker package due to security reasons.
  The new versions
  are:¬†cryptography¬†44.0.0,¬†pyJWT¬†2.10.1¬†and¬†setuptools¬†to¬†75.8.0.
  [#2628](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2628)
- Added `Clear()` function to text index for the `DROP GRAPH` command ensuring
  that when the `DROP GRAPH;` command is executed, the associated text index is
  also cleared. [#2604](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2604)
- Implemented various performance improvements under the `Abort` code path. You
  can expect faster abort times.
  [#2589](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2589)
- Vector search is no longer experimental feature, so the
  `--experimental-enabled` and `--experimental-config` should no longer be used
  with vector indices. In other words, vector search has a stable API now. You
  can now create vector index with `CREATE VECTOR INDEX index_name ON
  :Label(property) WITH CONFIG configmap;` query and drop it with `DROP VECTOR
  INDEX index_name;` query. To learn more about vector index, refer to the
  [docs page](https://memgraph.com/docs/querying/vector-search).
  [#2500](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2500)
- Add RPC timeouts infrastructure increasing the robustness and reliability of
  the replication and high-availability automatic failover.
  [#2607](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2607)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Fixed a bug under the query memory tracker, causing inefficient recursive
  allocations. [#2634](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2634)
- Patch 3rd party dependency (RocksDB) to avoid mishandling of an exception.
  [#2618](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2618)
- Fixed memory ordering of the async timer because it was causing the system
  flakiness. [#2625](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2625)
- Fixed the `PeriodicCommit` crash if the commit generates replication error.
  [#2598](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2598)
- Corrected logic for removing edge type indices entries during an abort. This
  fix stops segfaults that could occur non-deterministically.
  [#2596](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2596)
- Fixed deadlock by releasing RPC lock before acquiring the engine lock. When
  checking replica state, main will release RPC lock before taking the engine
  lock to avoid deadlock with commit thread.
  [#2515](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2515)
- Fixed deadlock when reading replication state during commit.
  [#2577](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2577)
- Fixed data race with edge type indexes and their cleanup. This fix prevents
  potential for segfaults.
  [#2588](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2588)
- Fixed bug of delta objects not releasing after unique constraint violation.
  Unique constraint error would release the deltas to GC as part of Abort, but
  not make the commit timestamp as finished. Hence the deltas and any future
  deltas would be prevented from being deleted during GC resulting in a memory
  leaks. [#2566](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2566)
- Fixed perf regression by moving the GC work to be done less frequently.
  Recent fix for ensuring memory was being released caused a noticeable cost to
  throughput for single_vertex_write benchmark.
  [#2576](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2576)
- Fix `convert.str2object` in C++ to work for primitives.
  [#2559](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2559)
- Fix MATCH after CALL not being able to execute a valid plan. It's possible
  now to use MATCH after CALL clause.
  [#2550](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2550)

### MAGE v3.0.0 - Jan 29th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes</h4>}

- uuid_generator now uses a different method of generating UUIDs so it might
  not be compatible with the one in previous versions.
  [#538](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/538)
- Rewrite refactor modules not to use deleted API (`EdgeSetTo`, `EdgeSetFrom`
  and `EdgeChangeType` were removed from Memgraph under
  [#2530](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2530)).
  `refactor.from`,¬†`refactor.to`,¬†`refactor.invert`,¬†`refactor.delete_and_reconnect`,
  and¬†`refactor.rename_type`¬†now create a new edge instead of modifying the old
  one. This requires changes if you rely on an internal edge ID (previously, it
  would stay the same; now, it changes due to the creation of a new edge).
  [#536](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/536)
- Dynamic algorithms were removed from MAGE and moved under Memgraph
  Enterprise. [#540](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/540)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- Rewrite the UUID module to be the same as on the
  [memgraph/memgraph](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph) repo.
  [#538](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/538)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Fixed DGL issues. [#540](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/540)

### Lab v3.0.1 - Jan 30th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Fixed node icons in query data results and
  graph schema, ensuring correct visualization
  and consistency.

### Lab v3.0.0 - Jan 29th, 2025

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes</h4>}

- **GraphChat Migration**: Messages and LLM setups from
  previous versions of the Lab will not be migrated to
  the new GraphChat due to the complexity and enhanced
  organizational structure introduced in this update.

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- Organize your GraphChat conversations with
  the ability to create multiple message threads,
  improving structure and clarity.
- Set up DeepSeek LLM models for your Graph Chat,
  expanding your model options and customization.
- Instead of being limited to a single model per
  provider (e.g., Ollama, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI,
  DeepSeek) in your Graph Chat, you can now create
  and manage multiple models for each provider, each
  with unique configurations and model references.
- GraphChat conversation history is now used as a
  reference, making chats contextually aware.
  Configure the size of the conversation context
  as needed.
- Add feedback to individual messages in GraphChat
  to exclude them from future context, improving
  conversation precision.
- Leverage multiple GraphChat views within Lab
  layouts to run LLM questions in parallel.
- Each GraphChat answer includes step-by-step details,
  queries, token counts, and schema references,
  simplifying debugging and analysis.
- GraphChat will automatically retry Cypher generation
  for failed queries. Configure retry limits and view
  details for each attempt.
- Enterprise license users can now [manage Graph Style Script
  (GSS)](/data-visualization/user-manual/graph-style-script-sharing) with
  [remote storage](/data-visualization/user-manual/remote-storage), enabling
  team collaboration and script sharing. You can balance between locally stored
  and remotely saved scripts to suit your workflow.
- A dismissable notice now alerts you if `vm.max_map_count`
  is not configured correctly for [optimal Memgraph performance](/database-management/system-configuration#increasing-memory-map-areas).
- Switch Lab to dark mode from the application settings.

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- The graph schema view now displays property count, fill
  percentages and property types for all nodes and
  relationships in the database. To access full graph
  information, ensure Memgraph is running with the
  `--schema-info-enabled` [configuration](/querying/schema#run-time-schema-tracking).
- When connecting to a coordinator instance in a Memgraph
  HA environment (version 3.0.0 or later), the status bar
  now displays real-time information about whether you're
  connected to a leader or a follower node.

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Screenshots are now generated as expected when saving
  graph style scripts from query execution.

### Memgraph v2.22.1 - Dec 22, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- The `convert.str2object` function was rewritten from Python to C++ so Python
  GIL does not bottleneck it. Users are now able to achieve the necessary
  parallelization improvements.
  [#2532](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2532)
- Added `SHOW INSTANCE` query to expose more information about the coordinator
  instance to which the user is connected. The query returns: `instance_name`,
  `bolt_server`, `coordinator_server`, `management_server` and `cluster_role`.
  [#2526](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2526)
- Added¬†`REMOVE COORDINATOR <ID>`¬†query. Only followers can be removed from
  Raft logs. The request to remove a leader won't be accepted in Raft logs.
  [#2533](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2533)
- Updated `librdkafka` to v2.6.1. You can expect better stability on the Kafka
  streaming side. [#2523](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2523)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Fixed a bug when a replica received an old WAL file by ignoring it.
  Previously, a replica could receive a WAL file that contains all old data. If
  that is the case, the old epoch would be added to the history together with
  the current durable timestamp on the replica, causing the wrong information
  contained inside the replica. Replicas shouldn't naively use data from WAL
  files received. [#2552](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2552)
- Fixed a subtle memory leak. The skip_list used for async timers was
  previously not being collected. `--query-execution-timeout-sec` caused an
  allocation that was small but not free.
  [#2539](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2539)
- Fixed error message when unloading query message with a correct description
  of what happens. An additional reason why the unloading of a module might
  fail is that the module might not exist.
  [#2547](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2547)
- Fixed planner so it can always generate at least one valid plan. Valid plans
  are currently all the ones that start expanding from a node. There was an
  edge case where no valid plan could be constructed, as all constructed plans
  would start expanding from an edge without edge indices in place.
  [#2543](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2543)
- Fixed the incorrect management of the delta counter metric after the abort.
  `SHOW STORAGE INFO` under `unreleased_delta_objects` should be better now.
  [#2544](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2544)
- Fixed the case when the database would crash without any valid query plan
  generated for a given query. Instead of the crash, the database will throw
  the `QueryException`. [#2537](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2537)
  and [#2535](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2535)
- Fixed issue with list pattern pattern comprehension under arbitrary
  expression. List pattern comprehension is only allowed under `WITH` and
  `RETURN` clauses. [#2534](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2534)
- Fixed a bug under after-commit triggers where the database accessor becomes
  invalid after the transaction finishes. Before the fix, Memgraph would crash
  if the trigger used the access to access the changed entities under the
    graph. [#2536](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2536)
- Fixed the case when recovery and promotion are executed concurrently on a
  replica. The promotion request will wait for recovery to finish before
  preparing storage for the new epoch.
  [#2521](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2521)
- Fixed how `metrics` keyword was added to the grammar. The keyword couldn't be
  used as a variable name.
  [#2502](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2502)

### MAGE v1.22.1 - Dec 22, 2024

- The MAGE version was only bumped because there is a new version of Memgraph
  (v2.22.1). Nothing changed under the MAGE itself.

### Memgraph v2.22.0 - Nov 27, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes</h4>}

- `--experimental-enabled=high-availability` does not exist anymore. If you
  used the feature, please remove the experimental flag because it's no longer
  necessary. [#2479](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2479)
- `any(v IN [] WHERE v)` was returning `Null`; since this release, it returns
  `False`. [#2489](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2489)
- We improved global settings error messages (log to stderr and log level);
  this might be a breaking change if you rely on exact error message text.
  [#2494](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2494)

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- The first version of the vector search feature was added. To enable and
  configure the feature, use `--experimental-enabled=vector-search` and
  `--experimental-config` flags. Learn more under the [vector search
  documentation page](/querying/vector-search).
  [#2406](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2406)
- The data snapshotting (point-in-time backups of the graphs) management has
  been improved. It's possible now to use crontab syntax to specify when the
  snapshot will be created.
  [#2435](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2435)
- Added `IsEmpty` function that accepts `Null` (`IsEmpty(Null)` returns
  `Null`), `List`, `Map`, `String` and returns `Boolean` value.
  [#2489](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2489)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- High-availability automatic failover became the stable feature üéâ
  `--experimental-enabled=high-availability` flag is not required anymore.
  Please visit [high-availability](/clustering/high-availability) page to learn
  more about the feature.
  [#2479](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2479)
- The planner now utilizes the point index for `point.withinbbox` queries and
  makes `point.distance` queries using the index without the `WITH` statement.
  This improvement results in faster queries when using the mentioned spatial
  features. [#2449](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2449)

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Hiding passwords under logs wasn't handled well in case of double quotes.
  That's fixed now, so you don't have to worry that the passwords will get
  exposed. [#2488](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2488)
- Fix crashes (only in debug mode) when using point functions, for example, by
  providing x, y, z, and CRS for 2D points and vice versa.
  [#2463](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2463)
<details>
<summary>
  High-availability automatic failover updates
</summary>
<span>
  The code changes below improve the high-availability automatic failover,
  resulting in a more stable Memgraph runtime in that environment.
</span>
<ul>
  <li>
    - Properly handle failures in WAL replication. An interpreter will now throw an
    exception during commit instead of calling abort when the main becomes a
    replica with a write transaction to be committed. Furthermore, the replica
    instance won't crash if it receives an existing vertex.
    <a href="https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2467">[#2467]</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    - The system will now correctly handle situations where the main gets re-elected as
    main again. <a href="https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2472">[#2472]</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    - The `SHOW INSTANCES` query will now run correctly when the leader becomes a
    follower. <a href="https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2474">[#2474]</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    - Fix that will not allow a sync replica to be READY while being behind by
  aligning the recovery timestamp check with timestamp modifications. <a href="https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2476">[#2476]</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    - When a main instance misses a failover and is selected to be the new main, Raft
    generates a new UUID. Previously, replicas wouldn't update their durability,
    and MAIN wouldn't update its clients. Now, when swapping UUIDs,
    durability and active clients are updated correctly.
    <a href="https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2478">[#2478]</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    - Users must set `--coordinator-hostname` when starting a coordinator in HA.
    Previously, the database would crash; now, it logs an error message.
    <a href="https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2482">[#2482]</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    - Instance-level clients can now safely be closed after committing. Previously, a
    promotion request executed in parallel with committing could cause data instance locking.
    <a href="https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2485">[#2485]</a>

### MAGE v1.22.0 - Nov 27, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes </h4>}

- [Link
  prediction](https://memgraph.com/docs/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/gnn_link_prediction),
  [node
  classification](https://memgraph.com/docs/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/gnn_node_classification)
  and
  [text](https://memgraph.com/docs/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/text)
  modules are available again.
  [#528](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/528)
- The built-in authentication module dependencies are now pre-installed also
  under MAGE Docker images. This mainly refers to the built-in SSO modules that
  depend on third-party libraries to offer a secure way of authenticating into
  Memgraph instances. [#526](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/526)

### Lab v2.19.1 - Nov 27, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Resolved an issue where username and password inputs were not displayed
  correctly on the login screen in the Desktop app when authentication
  was required.

### Lab v2.19.0 - Nov 27, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header">‚ú® New features</h4>}

- The Lab web application can now be started on a [custom base
  path](/data-visualization/user-manual/custom-base-path) using the environment
  variable `BASE_PATH`, which is useful for reverse proxy configurations.

{<h4 className="custom-header">üõ†Ô∏è Improvements</h4>}

- In multi-tenant environments, a search bar is added to filter databases by
  name.
- You can now view the complete Memgraph URI and Memgraph version by clicking on
  the connection in the top left corner.

{<h4 className="custom-header">üêû Bug fixes</h4>}

- Fixed an issue where logs failed to disconnect
  from the previous Memgraph connection in the Desktop
  app.
- The authentication screen for entering a username
  and password when connecting to Neo4j now displays
  correctly.

### Memgraph v2.21.0 - Nov 6, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Upgrading to Memgraph v2.21.0 breaking change </h4>}

<Callout type="info">

Coordinator log store directory in `--data-directory` needs to be started from
scratch since new type of Raft log is added and some old ones were deleted.
Memgraph could crash without deleting old logs from log store directory.

</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Added planner optimization to replace `point.distance` filter with an index
  scan. Queries like `WITH point({x:0,y:0}) AS a MATCH (m:L1) WHERE
  point.distance(m.prop, a) < 1 RETURN m;`, should run faster if there is the
  [point index](/fundamentals/indexes#point-index) created. If you are dealing
  with spatial data, there is a high chance you need such indexes to run your
  queries faster. [#2362](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2362)
- Significantly improved schema retrieval performance in both TRANSACTIONAL and
  ANALYTICAL setups. Feel free to use `--schema-info-enabled=True` to get
  schema instantly by running the `SHOW SCHEMA INFO;` query.
  [#2383](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2383)
- Added query metadata when logging incoming query. It's possible now, e.g., to
  filter certain database log entries or search for specific items in the log.
  [#2404](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2404)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Closing instance would crash due to streams and/or TTL running in the
  background. [#2361](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2361)
- Add backticks around property keys in any \{key: value\} patterns.
  [#2371](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2371)
- When replica gets promoted to main upon failover, it will use correctly
  incremented durable timestamp.
  [#2366](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2366)
- `schema.assert` will throw an exception if ran inside the explicit transaction.
  [#2352](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2352)
- Modifying `mgp::memory` is prohibited; use `MemoryDispatcherGuard` instead.
  Under C++ query modules, if module tries to set `mgp::memory` there will be a
  compilation error. Usually at the beginning of the `mgp_init_module`
  implementation there should be the `mgp::MemoryDispatcherGuard
  guard(memory);`. Usage examples could be found under [MAGE C++
  modules](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/tree/main/cpp).
  [#2424](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2424)
- Fixed incorrect usage of cv and stop token in scheduler and thread pool.
  [#2452](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2452)
- Fixed unreleased deltas counter. There was a missing case of tracking when
  deltas were actually released. This gave the appearance in `SHOW STORAGE
  INFO;` that we were not actually releasing them.
  [#2446](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2446)
- Fixed edge index not removing deleted edges. Edge index would not remove
  deleted (obsolete) entries, while the GC would delete the edge object. Edge
  type index was impacted, while the property type would detect that the object
  was deleted due to it checking the property.
  [#2439](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2439)
- Removed usage of RTLD_DEEPBIND under query modules. Query modules, especially
  the Python ones should work better in terms of correct module loading.
  [#2347](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2347)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> High-availability automatic failover improvements </h4>}

There are a lot of efforts to make Memgraph HA rock-solid in the production
environments. Under this release, the feature is still experimental, but
getting very close to put the stable flag next to it. The full list if issues
and improvements can be found
[HERE](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/issues?q=label%3Ajepsen) (GH issues
labeled with `jepsen`).

- All data instances now use one type of callbacks to simplify state
  reconciliation. [#2421](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2421)
- Incomplete storage reset when MAIN force reset or applied snapshots to
  REPLICA. [#2422](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2422)
- Coordinators now use one type of Raft logs to remove the need for distributed
  locks. Coordinator log store needs to be started from scratch, hence this
  change is a breaking one.
  [#2430](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2430)
- Fixed deadlock when demoting data instance. When a coordinator sends a
  request for promotion or demotion, the lock on replication state is taken so
  that it cannot be interleaved with commit. If main became a replica and was
  executing write transaction, the transaction will be aborted. Scheduler is
  now stopped before thread pool in RPC client.
  [#2447](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2447)

### MAGE v1.21.0 - Nov 6, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Added [Leiden
  algorithm](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/leiden_community_detection).
  The implementation is "static" in a sense that it's operating on the whole
  graph. Leiden is a modern community detection algorithm that in Memgraph's
  implementation provides hierarchies of communities. A big use-cases for
  Leiden community detection is [GraphRAG](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag).
  [#508](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/508)

### Lab v2.18.2 - Nov 7, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- You can now edit or remove connections with long
  names that previously overrode the edit/remove action.
- Fixed issue where disk usage in the status bar
  showed memory usage instead (bug introduced in 2.18.0).
- Removed the "Danger Zone" from the overview.

### Lab v2.18.1 - Nov 6, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Resolved error with newer Ollama models causing
  "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')"
  when using the GraphChat feature.

### Lab v2.18.0 - Nov 6, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Enable HTTPS in Lab without needing a reverse proxy,
  using self-signed or custom certificates with environment
  variables `SSL_IS_ENABLED`, `SSL_CERT_PATH` and
  `SSL_KEY_PATH`.
- Logs in the Lab no longer show system Cypher calls with
  Memgraph version 2.21 or above.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- SSO redirect for Lab when configured with HTTPS works
  as expected now.

### Memgraph v2.20.1 - Oct 10, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- When a replica gets promoted to main upon [failover](/clustering/high-availability#failover), it will now use correctly incremented durable timestamp. [#2366](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2366)
- Replica will now take MAIN's [uuid](/clustering/high-availability#how-replica-knows-which-main-to-listen) only when REPLICA's current sequence number is 0. [#2388](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2388)
- Eliminated deadlock caused by concurrent calls to Stop method on the Scheduler. Eliminated deadlock caused by calling Pause after Stop from different threads. [#2398](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2398)
- Fixed a problem where [EdgeType index](/fundamentals/indexes#edge-type-index) would assign every element as obsolete which then caused the index to be incorrectly emptied by the GC. Fixed another problem where [EdgeTypeProperty index](/fundamentals/indexes#edge-type-property-index) never ran its GC. Now properly prevents edge index creation when properties-on-edges is disabled - the user must explicitly [provide](/database-management/configuration#storage) --storage-properties-on-edges. Now correctly prevents Edge indices being recovered when properties-on-edges is disabled by causing an assert during recovery. [Replication](/clustering/replication) now updates edge indices. [#2390](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2390)
- Replica now correctly reflects database registration success or failure.  When replica receives a request for registering replica, it will now return status code NOT_MAIN.  If attempting to undo an incomplete registration fails, then the Memgraph instance will be intentionally crashed because the system is in unrecoverable state.  Main instance can now deal with stale RPC message GetReplicaUUID without crashing the instance.  [#2373](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2373)
- Closing instance no longer crashes due to [streams](/data-streams) and/or [TTL](/querying/time-to-live) running in the background. [#2361](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2361)

### Lab v2.17.0 - Sep 25, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- A monitoring dashboard is available, offering
  enhanced insights into the state of your data and potential
  optimization opportunities for your Memgraph
  Enterprise instance.
- Choose a custom model for the OpenAI GraphChat integration
  instead of being limited to the default `gpt-4`.
- GraphChat is more consistent with its responses due to a
  change in the LLM temperature setting from `0.7` to `0.01`.
- GraphChat will attempt to correct invalid Cypher queries
  up to three times, ensuring more reliable query generation.
- Graph schema generation is now almost instant when the
  Memgraph configuration parameter `schema-info-enabled` is
  set to `true`.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Drag-and-drop sorting of query collections now
  maintains the correct order as expected.
- User permissions, status bar stats, and replication status
  are now aligned. Instead of breaking the connection due to
  permission issues, users will now see "N/A" where applicable.

### Memgraph v2.20.0 - Sep 25, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Upgrading to Memgraph v2.20.0 breaking change </h4>}

<Callout type="info">

In this version of Memgraph, we have removed the experimental classification for
system replication. Going forward, the `--experimental-enabled` configuration
flag no longer recognizes the `system-replication` argument which was introduced
in v2.15.
[System replication](/clustering/replication/system-replication) is now a fully
supported Enterprise-licensed feature.

</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- [Enterprise] Graduated replication to ‚Äúproduction‚Äù from ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù. [#2295](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2295)
- Up to date schema tracking, available for In Memory Transactional and In Memory Analytical. [#2256](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2256)
- New index on geospatial datatype. [#2298](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2298)
- Added SASL2 support for Memgraph with Kafka streaming. [#2305](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2305)
- Query planner now leverages edge type indices and edge-property indices. [#2293](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2293)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Reverted a performance regression related to logging. [#2316](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2316)
- No longer skips post_update callback when recovering flag value data from durability module. [#2274](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2274)
- Now correctly cleans any edge indices during abort. [#2310](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2310)
- No longer adds entries to the wrong label+property index. [#2294](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2294)
- Remove deadlock during streaming database destruction. [#2288](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2288)
- Fix IPv6 endpoint version resolution. [#2281](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2281)
- Fix failover recovery when missing WAL or invalid state machine. [#2241](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2241)

- Altered ‚Äúbecome leader‚Äù callback HA logic to always do check of whole cluster to avoid data loss. [#2248](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2248)


### Memgraph v2.19.0 - Aug 14, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking changes </h4>}

- Fixed an issue where `LocalDateTime` did not convert user date to UTC
properly. `LocalDateTime` now considers the set database [timezone for
conversions](/fundamentals/data-types#localdatetime). A new [command-line
argument and database setting](/fundamentals/data-types#database-timezone) for
timezone have been added, allowing users to define the database timezone for
accurate `LocalDateTime` conversions.
[#2204](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2204)

- The `--data-recovery-on-startup` flag is now set to `true` by default. This
ensures that all user data will be recovered on startup without needing to
specify any configuration options.
[#2178](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2178)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- [Enterprise Ed.] Added functionality to hide sensitive information,
specifically passwords, in query logs. Passwords in queries are now masked with
asterisks (*).
[#2140](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2140)

- Introduced the [`SHOW ACTIVE USERS
INFO`](/database-management/server-stats#active-users-information) command,
which allows users to view a list of active users along with detailed session
information.
[#2183](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2183)

- Added support for [periodic
commits](/querying/read-and-modify-data#periodic-execution) within Cypher
queries, allowing for batched execution. This enhancement prevents memory
exhaustion by committing intermediate results during the execution of large
queries.
[#2182](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2182)
[#2194](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2194)
[#2196](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2196)
[#2197](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2197)
[#2217](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2217)

- Added the Time-to-Live (TTL) feature, enabling users to tag nodes with an
expiration time. A background thread automatically deletes these nodes and their
associated edges once they expire.
[#2167](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2167)

- Users can now define their passwords directly using a hash, allowing for more
secure authentication methods.
[#2148](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2148)

- Added property compression across the graph using the zlib compression
library. This feature introduces [new configuration
flags](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#property-compression)
`--storage-property-store-compression-enabled` and
`--storage-property-store-compression-level`, allowing users to enable
compression and set the desired compression level.
[#2102](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2102)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Fixed an issue where `SHOW REPLICAS` was returning an empty map for
`data_info` in the Community Edition due to an incorrect database name check.
[#2236](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2236)

- Optimized the deletion process for nodes and edges by deferring the removal of
obsolete index entries to the garbage collector (GC). This change improves
deletion performance by reclaiming memory after the GC cycle instead of
immediately.
[#2242](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2242)

- Fixed an issue where coordinators did not yield leadership according to the
`leadership_expiry_` flag. The leadership expiry is now correctly respected,
preventing the use of
`heart_beat_interval_*raft_server::raft_limits_.response_limit_` as the expiry
limit for nodes deemed unhealthy.
[#2224](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2224)

- Leadership now expires as it was intended, before the election period starts.
[#2224](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2224)

- Fixed a bug where no default database was selected when `MG_ENTERPRISE=OFF`.
[#2267](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2267)

- Fixed the endpoint for session closure by a peer and ensured it is correctly
reflected in the audit logs.
[#2181](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2181)

- Incorrect cache of query plan resulted in an incorrect sharing of resources
for some call procedures, which in rare cases could cause segfault. Regression
was introduced in v2.18.1.
[#2268](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2268)

### MAGE v1.19 - Aug 14, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- [Node2Vec](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/node2vec) now requires
either `hs` set to 1 or `negative` set to a positive integer instead of a
non-negative integer due to bumping Gensim version.
[#502](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/502)

### Lab v2.16.0 - Aug 14, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Select [different connection types](/data-visualization/user-manual/connection-types):
  standalone Memgraph, Memgraph in replication mode, and Memgraph in HA
  cluster mode.
- Connect to the Memgraph HA cluster and see the cluster status of your
  coordinators and data instances in real-time.
- Connect to the Memgraph main instance in replicated mode and see the
  replication status in real-time.
- Connect directly to the Coordinator to run cluster management queries.
- Configure optional proxy endpoint for the OpenAI model in the GraphChat.
- Choose a custom model for the Ollama GraphChat integration instead of
  the default model `llama2`.
- Graph results on retina displays have 15% faster rendering with better
  display quality.
- For empty or invalid Graph Style Script you will receive a warning
  message instead of empty graph results.
- Clearing a database before loading a predefined dataset will use less
  memory now because it removes data in batches.
- Clearing a database before loading a predefined dataset will remove
  triggers too along with nodes, relationships, indexes and constraints.
- Set environment variable `LOG_STACKTRACE_IS_ENABLED` to true
  to see the stack trace for the error logs.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Display graph options are now applied correctly if you pick a color/text
  before choosing the option "This node" or "All nodes with the same label".


### Memgraph v2.18.1 - Jul 23, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking changes </h4>}

- Introduced [management servers on coordinators](/clustering/high-availability)
to get the health state of the cluster. Each coordinator now has a management
server and client connection to all other coordinators. This allows follower
coordinators to correctly report health states by contacting the leader
coordinator. [#2138](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2138)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Added current amount of unreleased delta objects to the [`SHOW STORAGE
INFO`](/configuration/server-stats) query.
[#2066](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2066)

- Added a new query, [`SHOW METRICS
INFO`](/database-management/server-stats#metrics-information), which exposes the
same metrics available from the HTTP endpoint, now accessible via a query.
[#2052](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2052)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Fixed an issue with the wrong handling of NuRaft config logs in HA durability,
where the logs were parsed from RocksDB as text although they are serialized in
NuRaft binary format. [#2189](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2189)

- Fixed edge type property index lookup scan. The edge type property index scan
now correctly fills vertices in the frame, preventing queries that construct a
path based on edge type property index from returning nulls. The edge type
property index scan is disabled for more complex queries, defaulting to
`ScanAll` instead.
[#2190](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2190)

- Controlled delta allocations to improve memory management in
`IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL` mode. Deltas now use a dedicated PMR allocator for
property values and other delta allocations, allowing for quick and trivial
destruction of deltas post-query. This change aligns resident memory with
expectations for `IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL`, which never allocates deltas.
[#2151](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2151)

- In HA, the election timeout is now set between 2000ms and 4000ms, with the
heartbeat interval occurring every second. These values are chosen to tolerate
occasional network hiccups without triggering unnecessary leadership changes.
[#2207](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2207)

- C and C++ query modules are a lot faster now and no longer slow down when ran
concurrently.
[#2176](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2176)

- Correctly handle memory limits when triggered by allocations in third-party
code.
[#2191](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2191)

- Fixed the enums dump function to correctly print all enum values.
[#2168](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2168)

- Correction for `propertySize` function when enums are inside Lists/Maps. The
internal reader now reads the correct number of bytes, preventing issues where
the reader was positioned incorrectly.
[#2205](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2205)


### Memgraph v2.18.0 - Jul 3, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Upgrading to Memgraph v2.18.0 </h4>}

<Callout type="info">

If you are upgrading to Memgraph v2.18.0 from any previous versions and you
have a persistent configuration file (docker volumes or native install) due to
the [breaking changes in the configuration
file](/release-notes#memgraph-v2180---jul-3-2024) you need to set manually
`--data-recovery-on-startup=true` to restore data on startup.

If you do not set `--data-recovery-on-startup=true`, Memgraph will start without
data recovery and your data (snapshots at `var/lib/memgraph/snapshots`) will be
overwritten by the newly created periodical snapshots, potentially causing data
loss, depending on the configurations of snapshot creation.

If you think you have experienced data loss and added
`--data-recovery-on-startup=true`, stopping Memgraph creates a new snapshot by
default, and starting Memgraph will restore the data from the last snapshot,
there is a possibility that the snapshot with data is still present in the
`var/lib/memgraph/snapshots` folder, depending on how long Memgraph was running
and how many times it was restarted.

To prevent data loss in all cases, before upgrading to Memgraph v2.18.0,
create a
[backup of your data directory](https://memgraph.com/docs/deployment/linux#backup-data) (`var/lib/memgraph`).

</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking changes </h4>}

- Configuration flag `--coordinator-hostname` is added, which is used to fix the
issue of having `0.0.0.0` in the output of `SHOW INSTANCES` on the first leader.
The flag has its environment variable equivalent in
`MEMGRAPH_COORDINATOR_HOSTNAME`. Now all coordinator instances [need to provide
a configuration option](/clustering/high-availability) for the coordinator
hostname. For local deployment, use `localhost`. For containerized deployments,
use the name of the container. This change is breaking because coordinators
cannot be started if this configuration option isn't set.
[#2131](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2131)

- The Coordinator's durability has been reinforced through enhanced storage of
RAFT's logs and snapshots, now persistently stored in the
`coordinator/raft_data/logs` folder. The [coordinator
configuration](/clustering/high-availability) is securely maintained in the
`coordinator/raft_data/network` folder, which is kept constantly durable. A new
flag, `--ha-durability`, allows for optional deactivation of this log and
snapshot durability if required.
[#2029](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2029)

- Removed [deprecated command-line flags](/database-management/configuration) to
  streamline configuration and improve system performance. The following flags
  are no longer supported: `--storage-recover-on-startup`,
  `--auth-module-create-missing-user`, `--auth-module-create-missing-role`,
  `--auth-module-manage-roles`, `--storage-parallel-index-recovery`.
[#1916](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1916)


{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Implemented lazy evaluation of replication DNS. When using DNS in replication,
its resolution is postponed until streaming data using RPC connections,
improving efficiency in replication setups. The replication durability version
has been bumped to V4, and the corresponding migration function has been added.
[#2060](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2060)

- [`SHOW INSTANCES`](/clustering/high-availability#show-instances) now returns
non-resolved IP addresses when using DNS in an HA cluster. DNS is resolved every
time data is streamed using RPC connections, ensuring seamless reconnections in
Kubernetes clusters even if a Pod is restarted. The `IPFamily` attribute is no
longer persisted as part of the `Endpoint` class.
[#2051](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2051)

- A new flag,
  [`--nuraft-log-file`](/database-management/configuration#high-availability),
has been added to explicitly manage logs coming from NuRaft.
[#2084](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2084)

- Coordinator won't start if the `--instance-down-timeout-sec` option is smaller
than the `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec` option, ensuring that
[configuration options](/database-management/configuration#high-availability)
for health pings are valid before starting the Memgraph coordinator instance.
[#2100](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2100)

- Validation added for the `experimental-enabled` flag. Users can now view logs
detailing which experimental features are enabled.
[#2106](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2106)

- In addition to specifying log file paths via the `--nuraft-log-file flag`,
users can now set the `MEMGRAPH_NURAFT_LOG_FILE` [environment
variable](/database-management/configuration#environment-variables) to [control
the location of NuRaft logs](/clustering/high-availability).
[#2113](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2113)

- Users can now see who is the leader and who are the followers in the output of
[`SHOW INSTANCES`](/clustering/high-availability#show-instances). This
enhancement provides clearer visibility into the roles of instances within a
high-availability cluster.
[#2126](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2126)

- Memgraph now [supports Single
Sign-On](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/auth-system-integrations)
(SSO) modules. This feature allows for custom authentication schemes, enabling
users to log in using user-defined authentication modules. Upon receiving a Bolt
message for authorization, Memgraph will utilize the specified auth module for
the login process. The `--auth-module-executable` flag has been deprecated and
replaced by `--auth-module-mappings=basic`.
[#1990](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1990)

- Users can now connect to Memgraph [without specifying a
database](/database-management/multi-tenancy). If a user has a default database,
they will connect to that database. If not, they will connect without a database
defined, allowing only database-less queries. Users can also define the database
via the client, executing each query against the specified database.
Multi-tenant authentication will be executed upon the first query execution.
[#1884](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1884)

- Improved query optimization by unifying multiple property-based filters into a
single filter that applies both upper and lower bounds.
[#2055](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2055)

- Introduced the USING HOPS LIMIT x syntax, enabling users to limit the number
of hops (edges crossed) during [graph
traversals](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal). This enhancement helps in
measuring and controlling the amount of work done in the traversal. This feature
covers traversals in the case of BFS, DFS and simple expand.
[#1928](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1928)

- Peak memory usage during the entire Memgraph run is now recorded and available
in [`SHOW STORAGE
INFO`](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#inspect-memory-usage) and the metrics
server. This allows users to monitor memory usage more effectively and helps in
optimizing performance.
[#2048](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2048)

- Memgraph now supports an external module that enables Single Sign-On (SSO)
using the [SAML
protocol](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/auth-system-integrations#saml).
This module validates SAML responses and supports identity providers such as
Microsoft Entra ID and Okta.
[#2049](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2049)

- Added support for Single Sign-On (SSO) using [OIDC and OAuth2.0
protocol](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/auth-system-integrations#openid-connect-oidc).
[#2045](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2045)

- The support for the [Enum datatype](/fundamentals/data-types#enum) has been
added. Enums can be used to enhance query performance and reduce memory usage
compared to string representations.
[#2039](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2039)

- Add support for [edge type property index](/fundamentals/indexes).
[#1964](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1964)

- Added functionality that allows each user to [change their own
password](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/users).
[#2097](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2097)

- Removed support for Amazon Linux 2, CentOS 7 and Red Hat 7  [Linux
distributions](/getting-started/install-memgraph/direct-download-links).
[#2165](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2165)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- [Metrics can now be fetched](/database-management/monitoring) via the HTTP
server during runtime if a Memgraph Enterprise license is enabled.
[#2067](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2067)

- Removed redundant duplicate label filtering.
[#2114](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2114)

- Fixed an issue where filters following a Cartesian operation were not always
correctly embedded into index scans, causing some query plans to miss a
Cartesian-to-Join swap.
[#1924](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1924)

- Resolved an issue where constants were incorrectly used as grouping keys in
aggregation queries.
[#2095](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2095)

- Resolved an issue where the routing table request logic inaccurately
identified the MAIN instance when the previous MAIN was not operational.
[#2133](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2133)

- Fixed an issue where the HA cluster would deadlock if an instance was down
when registered and it was the only instance in the cluster.
[#2135](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2135)

- This fix addresses a replication bug that previously prevented data and
metadata deltas from being in the same transaction. Metadata deltas are now sent
first to ensure the replica uses unique access, making automatic index creation
fully compatible with high availability and replication capabilities.
[#2125](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2125)

### MAGE v1.18 - Jul 3, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Added a PostgreSQL [migration module to
MAGE](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/migrate) that enables direct
migration from a PostgreSQL database to Memgraph. This new module streamlines
the data import process by reducing the need for intermediate steps, such as
using CSV files. Users can now migrate tables, including nodes and
relationships, directly into Memgraph.
[#464](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/464)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Fixed building of newly created Rust query modules. Previously, there was a
logical error in the code that prevented new Rust query modules from being built
correctly.
[#483](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/483)


### Lab v2.15.0 - Jul 3, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Share a query with other users with access to the same
  Lab and Memgraph. Works only on Lab in Docker and with
  enterprise license.
- You can configure quick-connect to connect to Memgraph
  with an encrypted connection with the new environment
  variable `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_IS_ENCRYPTED`.
- The size of the Lab Docker image has been reduced to
  one-fifth of its original size.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Boolean `false` value is now shown correctly in the expanded
  row of query table results.
- Passwords are now hidden in the run history when running a
  query to create a new user with a password or change the
  user's password.

### Lab v2.14.0 - May 23, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Add SSO (single sign-on) configuration for Microsoft Entra ID and/or Okta with
  SAML and/or OAuth standard protocols (client only).
- Run a query from a query collection in any of the vertical
  and/or horizontal views with a selection dropdown next to
  the "Run query" button.
- For each query, query performance details will be in the
  query summary on how much time was spent on each part of
  your query: plan, parsing, execution and full roundtrip.
- `ZonedDateTime` data type will be presented with timezone
  information in the query data results table.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- A bug where you would be locked in the fullscreen mode after
  CSV import usage has been fixed.


### Memgraph v2.17.0 - May 22, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking changes </h4>}

- The flag
[`--replication-restore-state-on-startup`](/database-management/configuration)
is now set to `true` by default.
[#2031](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2031)

- Memgraph will now fail to start if the Bolt server cannot be created, ensuring
a dedicated port is available. Failures in creating the WebSocket and HTTP
servers will no longer crash Memgraph but will be logged more effectively. If
the WebSocket server fails, the `LoggerSink` will not be added to it.
Additionally, Memgraph will crash if the authentication folder cannot be
created.
[#2017](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2017)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Added functionality to [create a
user](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/users) or
[role](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control)
only if it does not already exist. This update prevents errors when creating a
user or role that already exists.
[#2032](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2032)

- Introduced Docker images specifically tailored for
[debugging](/database-management/debugging), with Memgraph built in the
`RelWithDebInfo mode`. These containers come equipped with essential debugging
tools such as `perf`, `gdb`, and `pgrep`, along with other useful apt packages.
[#2047](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2047)

- Added the capability to count the number of hops in queries for each
expansion. Each unit of work, including filtering on edge types, edge
properties, or visiting already processed nodes, is counted as a hop. The
total number of hops is returned in the `number_of_hops` field in the query
summary.
[#1935](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1935)

- Introduced a new small vector datatype (`16B`) with a small buffer
optimization. This new datatype is used for `Vertex` to have [smaller labels
collection and smaller edge collections](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage),
resulting in a `24B` reduction per `Vertex`.
[#1970](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1970)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Data instances now use `0.0.0.0:replication_port` for creating the replication
server instead of the instance's IP address. This update ensures that the
replication server starts correctly.
[#2038](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2038)

- The replication stream is now handled as a local variable for transactions,
preventing assertion failures during recovery.
[#2018](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2018)

- Implemented changes to discard leadership requests on follower instances. This
update ensures that followers no longer accept user actions intended for the
leader.
[#1932](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1932)

- Fixed a NuRaft launcher race condition. The raft server is now considered
successfully created once it behaves as a leader.
[#2040](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2040)


### Memgraph v2.16.1 - May 15, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking changes </h4>}

- Replicate only durable commits to replicas during recovery. This ensures that
  during the recovery process, replicas only receive commits that have been
  fsynced on the main node, preventing the replication of non-durable data and
  improving overall system consistency.
  [#1991](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1991)


{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Added exponential backoff to the coordinator force reset function. This
  improvement helps reduce pressure on logs and allows time for machines to come
  back online by implementing a backoff strategy that starts at 1 second and
  increases to 5 seconds, followed by resets every 5 seconds.
  [#1996](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1996)

- Upgraded the Clojure client dependencies. Memgraph now uses
  `gorillabs/neo4j-clj` version 5.0.0 for Jepsen testing, Clojure version
  1.11.2, and `neo4j-harness` version 5.10.0.
  [#1987](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1987)

- Added timezone support to Memgraph with the new [zoned datetime
  type](/fundamentals/data-types#zoneddatetime). This feature allows you to
  represent points in time with a defined timezone, enabling you to work with
  temporal data from different locales and easily migrate datasets with zoned
  values. [#1866](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1866)
  [#1976](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1976)

- Added `last_succ_resp_ms` and [coordinator health
  status](/configuration/high-availability) to the output of the `SHOW
  INSTANCES` command. This update allows users to see the elapsed time in
  milliseconds since the last successful response from instances to the leader's
  health ping, as well as the health status of the coordinator.
  [#1985](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1985)

- Added environment variables for HA Kubernetes cluster setup. This update
  allows starting the coordinator and data instances using environment
  variables, enhancing flexibility and ease of configuration for [high
  availability](/configuration/high-availability) clusters in Kubernetes
  environments. [#1951](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1951)

- Added an option to register a replica after the main instance has already been
  registered in a [high availability](/configuration/high-availability) (HA)
  setup. This feature enhances the flexibility of replica management in HA
  configurations. [#1911](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1911)

- Improved the output of the `SHOW INSTANCES` command. Changes include renaming
  `raft_socket_addr` to `coord_server` and `coordinator_socket_addr` to
  `mgmt_server`, and [adding the Bolt server to the
  output](/configuration/high-availability).
  [#1965](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1965)



{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Resolved an issue in the automatic index creation process where transactions
  creating multiple entities simultaneously could lead to unexpected behaviors.
  This patch ensures reliable auto index creation when dealing with multiple
  entity creations in a single transaction.
  [#1926](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1926)

- This fix ensures robust index rewriting and prevents potential core dumps in
  situations involving pattern comprehension within queries. Previously, the
  application could fail when using label or property-label indices with pattern
  comprehensions.
  [#1968](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1968)

- Addressed a flaw where skipped timestamps were not finalized on replicas,
  leading to inaccuracies in the oldest active timestamp information provided to
  the GC. This fix ensures all skipped timestamps are now marked as finalized,
  allowing the GC to accurately manage memory and clear Deltas as needed.
  Additionally, the RPC session buffer now resets to a maximum of 4 MiB
  post-session execution, improving memory management.
  [#2003](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2003)

- Fixed the DNS resolution capability for endpoint parsing. This update resolves
  issues with DNS resolution when registering replicas and/or coordinator
  instances. [#2004](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/2004)

- Expose coordinator's internal functionality to manage the cluster. Users can
  now execute actions such as `DEMOTE INSTANCE` and `FORCE RESET CLUSTER STATE`,
  which were previously internal operations. These functionalities allow users
  to reset cluster state and promote their chosen instance to be the MAIN.
  [#1981](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1981)


### Memgraph v2.16.0 - Apr 10, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

  deletes data in the database in an efficient manner.
  [#1723](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1723)
- Fixed a bug that caused the incorrect coordinator to become the leader due to
  missing cluster state data.
  [#1897](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1897)
- Added support for [edge type indices](/fundamentals/indexes#edge-type-index)
  to optimize query performance on graphs.
  [#1542](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1542)
- Added [automatic index creation](/fundamentals/indexes) for node labels and
  edge types. Two new configuration flags control this feature for labels and
  edge-types automatically encountered by the database.
  [#1841](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1841)
- Added support for `bolt+routing` when connecting to a cluster of Memgraph
  instances. [#1796](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1796)
- Expanded the [`min()` and `max()`](/querying/functions#aggregation-functions)
  functions to support temporal types, improving date and time manipulation
  capabilities.
  [#1790](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1790)
- Renamed [HA flags](/configuration/configuration-settings#high-availability)
  `--raft-server-id` to `--coordinator-id`, `--raft-server-port` to
  `--coordinator-port`, `--coordinator-server-port` to `--management-port`
  to improve cluster setup.
  [#1820](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1820)
  - Reduced the size of the Delta from 80B to 56B
  [#1747](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1747)
- Extended the C/C++ API to support [query
  execution](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api#executionheaders).

  replication instances and coordinator instances.
  [#1809](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1809)
- [Introduced the lock on operations](/configuration/high-availability) such as
  `SETTING INSTANCE` to MAIN, `REGISTER INSTANCE`, `UNREGISTER INSTANCE`, and
  `FAILOVER` for better control of the cluster state.
  [#1819](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1819)
- When doing failover, the Coordinator [chooses a new
  MAIN](/configuration/high-availability) by comparing which `memgraph` database
  is up-to-date. [#1729](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1729)
- [Changing instance's replication role](/configuration/high-availability) is
  now backed by Raft. [#1728](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1728)
- If REPLICA diverges from MAIN, MAIN will automatically initiate a forced data
  reset on REPLICA. [#1777](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1777)
- User can create, set, or remove labels using property values.
  [#1762](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1762)
- Introduced the ability to [fetch edges based on edge
  ID](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage).
  [#1808](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1808)
- Added support for [pattern
  comprehensions](/querying/expressions#pattern-comprehension) when used in
  `WITH` and  `RETURN` clauses.
  [#1827](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1827)
  [#1874](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1874)
  [#1903](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1903)
- Introduced a [force reset](/configuration/high-availability) feature to revert
  the cluster to its pre-operation state in case of failure.
  [#1836](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1836)


{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Added an early exit when doing `OR` filter expressions if the first expression
  evaluates to `true`.
  [#1738](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1738)
- Configuration settings are now properly verified to ensure that periodic
  snapshots are only taken when appropriate.
  [#1835](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1835)
- Improved replication stability in high-availability (HA) clusters to handle
  situations where the REPLICA node is several epochs or commits behind the MAIN
  node.
  [#1743](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1743)
- Fixed a bug that could occur when shutting down the Raft server. Initializing
  Memgraph enterprise instance without specifying any flag used in
  high-availability is now allowed.
  [#1823](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1823)
- Query allocations now use a single allocation subsystem rather than two.
  Memory no longer horded by bolt workers.
  [#1801](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1801)
- The [`schema.node_type_properties()` and `schema.rel_type_properties()`](/querying/schema)
  functions now work as equivalents to Neo4j's functions.
  [#1718](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1718)

### Memgraph v2.15.0 - Feb 28, 2024

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Upgrading to Memgraph v2.15.0 </h4>}

<Callout type="info">

Starting from Memgraph version 2.15.0, password hashing
has been fortified with salt for improved security. Previously, passwords were
hashed using SHA256 without salt. Please note that bcrypt, which is the default
hashing algorithm, has always incorporated salt for enhanced security.

- **Automatic Migration:** Passwords hashed without salt will be automatically
  reverted to the saltless algorithm upon upgrade. Subsequent successful logins
  trigger a rehashing process with salt, updating the data on disk.
- **Seamless Transition:** Most users will experience a seamless transition
  without any manual intervention. A user's first login post-upgrade triggers
  the hash update.
- **Migration Considerations:** Upon starting Memgraph version 2.15.0 for the
first time, ensure that the `--password-encryption-algorithm` flag is correctly
set to match the actual hashing algorithm used. This is crucial for maintaining
authentication data integrity.

</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Enhanced security by integrating a password hashing algorithm into
  authentication durability mechanisms, alongside existing password hashes.
  Passwords hashed with SHA-256 will be rehashed with salt upon validation for
  improved security.
  [#1644](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1644)

- Introduced a function `propertySize` to calculate the size of properties (in
  bytes) within Memgraph storage. For more details, refer to the
  [Functions documentation](/querying/functions).
  [#1557](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1557)

- The process of demoting old MAIN to REPLICA should eventually succeed fully
  without any issues.
  [#1711](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1711)

- The coordinator now aligns REPLICA to consistently listen to the correct MAIN.
  [#1711](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1711)

- Improved memory handling of Deltas. The value for Deltas is changed from  104B
  to 80B. For more details, refer to the [Storage memory usage
  documentation](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage).
  [#1688](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1688)

- Added support for query parameters in LOAD CSV. This enhancement allows users
  to dynamically specify file paths in the LOAD CSV clause. Executing queries
  like `LOAD CSV FROM $file AS row CREATE (:Node { column: row[0] });` is now
  possible, where `$file` is a variable representing a valid path to a CSV file.
  For more details, refer to the [Expressions documentation](/querying/expressions).
  [#1653](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1653)

- Added support for query parameters in RETURN LIMIT. Users can now specify the
  limit in a RETURN statement through a parameter, such as `MATCH (n) RETURN n
  LIMIT $limit;`. This addition makes it easier to dynamically adjust the number
  of results returned by a query. For more details, refer to the [Expressions
  documentation](/querying/expressions).
  [#1654](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1654)

- [Enterprise Ed.] Introduced an experimental feature flag for system
  replication (`--experimental-enabled=system-replication`). This new flag enables both
  authentication and multi-tenancy replication.

- Introduced enhancements for multi-tenancy support. The new `SHOW DATABASE;`
  command reveals the currently used database, returning `NULL` if none is
  active. `SHOW DATABASES;` has been updated to display only the existing set of
  multitenant databases. For more details, refer to the [Multi-tenancy
  documentation](/configuration/multi-tenancy).
  [#1550](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1550)

  [#1707](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1707)

- REPLICAs are now configured to listen exclusively to a single MAIN instance.
  In high availability (HA) setups, the coordinator now manages the assignment
  of REPLICA instances. For configurations using replication without HA, the
  MAIN instance directly communicates its ID to each REPLICA. For more details,
  refer to the [High availability
  documentation](/configuration/high-availability).
  [#1674](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1674)

- Added coordinator instance for managing HA cluster. For more details, refer to

  coordinators. For more details, refer to the [High availability
  documentation](/configuration/high-availability).
  [#1687](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1687)

- Improved the authentication module with better user and role handling mechanisms. For more
  details, refer to the [Auth module documentation](/configuration/auth-module).
  Key enhancements include:
  - Elimination of automatic user creation by the auth module
    - Introduction of checks to determine the presence of users or the use of an
      auth module before proceeding
  - Support for roles with database access
  - The `authenticate()` function now returns a user or role
  - When an auth module is in use, no data is locally saved
  - AuthChecker now generates `QueryUser` (user or role), which is responsible
    for actual authorization checks
  - Deprecated the following configuration flags:
    `--auth-module-create-missing-user`,  `--auth-module-create-missing-role`,
    `--auth-module-manage-roles`
    [#1699](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1699)
  - Introduced multi-tenancy and system information to [SHOW
  REPLICAS](/configuration/replication).

<Callout type="info">

Existence and unique [constraints](/fundamentals/constraints) can now also be
recovered in parallel, just like [indexes](/fundamentals/indexes). That is why
the `storage-parallel-index-recovery` configuration flag has been deprecated,

[`storage-parallel-schema-recovery`
configuration](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage) flag.

</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Now you can check information about node labels and relationship types by
  running the [schema-related queries](/querying/schema#schema-related-queries)
  `SHOW NODE_LABELS INFO;` and `SHOW EDGE_TYPES INFO;`.
  [#1466](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1466)
- When the [`schema.node_type_properties()` and the
  `schema.rel_type_properties()`
  procedures](/querying/schema#schema-related-procedures) output the `mandatory`
  values, the `True` value indicates a given node or relationship type is
  associated with only one property, instead of indicating the existance of any
  properties on the node or relationship.
  [#1510](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1510)
- Existence and unique [constraints](/fundamentals/constraints) can now also be
  recovered in parallel, just like [indexes](/fundamentals/indexes). To enable
  this behaviour, set the [`storage-parallel-schema-recovery`
  configuration](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage) flag to `true`.
  As the new configuration flag includes the constraints, the
  `storage-parallel-index-recovery` has been deprecated.
  [#1545](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1545)
- Now you can assert indexes and constraints using the
  [`schema.assert()`](/querying/schema#schema-assert) procedure.

  algorithms](https://memgraph.com/docs/advanced-algorithms/built-in-graph-algorithms)
  uses node properties, it will include all nodes of the path, even the start
  and end nodes. Also it's possible to mix node and relationships properties, by
  coalescing the relationship property in the weight lambda.
  [#1434](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1434)

- The cartesian evaluation of three MATCH clauses no longer uses sequential
  scanning, thus improving the performance of such queries.
  [#1555](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1555)
- A bug was fixed that would MATCH and RETURN wrong grouped aggregations.
  [#1518](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1518)
- Memgraph no longer throws a "Failed deallocation" error when working with the
  [`migrate` query module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/migrate).
  [#1492](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1492)
-  The [C, C++ and Python APIs](/custom-query-modules) have been extended with
  functions to check what storage mode is being used and whether graph elements
  (or lists/maps thereof) have been deleted. They allow the proper handling of
  deleted return values or query procedures and functions ran in [the
  in-memory analytical storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#implications) are now properly
  handled.[#1395](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1395)

- Procedures are no longer limited to 100 MB. They can use unlimited resources.
  If you want to [limit memory usage of
  procedures](/custom-query-modules/manage-query-modules#controlling-procedure-memory-usage)
  add `PROCEDURE MEMORY LIMIT 100 KB` after calling a procedure and before
  yielding results. [#1506](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1506)
- The [`SHOW STORAGE INFO;`](/configuration/server-stats) query now returns the
  non-swapped physical RAM memory a task has used (as reported by the operating
  system) as `memory_res`, not `memory_usage`. `memory allocated` has been
  replaced with `memory_tracked`, and it still defines the amount of RAM
  allocated in the system and tracked by Memgraph. The query also returns the
  number of memory-mapped areas that the kernel allows a process to have as
  `vm_max_map_count`. [#1408](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1408)
  [#1426](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1426)

  relationships or `convert.str2object()` function to convert strings to objects
  using Python's `json.dumps` function.
  [#1384](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1384)
- In your [custom query modules](/custom-query-modules), you can now remove the
  last element of a path in [C++ API](/custom-query-modules/cpp) using
  `path.Pop()`, [C API](/custom-query-modules/c) using `mgp_path_pop` and
  [Python API](/custom-query-modules/python) using `path.pop()`.
  [#1249](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1249)

  disk](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#storage-modes) is now 2x faster.
  [#1266](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1266)
- Searching for relationships stored on disk is now faster due to the ability to
  expand from a single node, rather than searching through all relationships.
  [#1335](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1335)
- Due to several smaller improvements, Memgraph uses less memory and the garbage
  collection is more efficient.
  [#1387](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1387)

### Memgraph v2.11.0 - Sep 13, 2023

<Callout type="warning">

`Node Properties()` and `Relationship
Properties()` getter from the [C++ API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api)
changed return type from `std::map` to `std::unordered_map` to speed up
execution time. Check your C++ query modules for possible code changes.

</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- `Node Properties()` and `Relationship Properties()` getter from the [C++
  API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api) changed return type from `std::map` to
  `std::unordered_map` to speed up execution time. This is a breaking change so
  check your C++ query modules for possible code changes.
  [#1131](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1131)

- The import of relationships in [on-disk storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#on-disk-transactional-storage-mode) can be
  improved by activating the `EDGE IMPORT MODE ACTIVE;`. When `EDGE IMPORT MODE`
  is disabled, the engine can import around 180 relationships per second. When
  active, the engine can import around 7500 relationships per second.
  [#1157](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1157).
- The following [configurational
  settings](/configuration/configuration-settings) can now be changed during
  runtime: server name, query execution timeout, log level and the option to log
  to `stderr`. Use the following queries to set the configuration:
  ```
  SET DATABASE SETTING 'server.name' TO 'new-name';
  SET DATABASE SETTING 'query.timeout' TO '100';
  SET DATABASE SETTING 'log.level' TO 'TRACE';
  SET DATABASE SETTING 'log.to_stderr' TO 'true`;
  ```
  [#1183](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1183)
- The default value of
  [`--bolt-server-name-for-init`](/configuration/configuration-settings#bolt) is
  now `Neo4j/v5.11.0 compatible graph database server - Memgraph`.
  [#1183](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1183)
- During recovery from a snapshot, the recovery of each graph object or property
  is no longer logged in the TRACE setting. The log now only indicates the
  recovery progress. [#1054](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1054)
- There have been various updates that improved performance:
  - Updating indexes and constraints has been streamlined, significantly improving
    execution time for everybody making heavy use of them.
    [#1159](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1159) [#1142](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1142)
  - Queries that build maps with multiple same-variable property lookups have been
    optimized. [#1168](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1168)
  - The batch update of properties improves performance when setting a large
    number of properties, as in this example:
    ```
    FOREACH (i in range(0, 1000000) | CREATE (n:Label {id:i}));

    CREATE INDEX ON :Label(id);

    FOREACH (i IN range(0, 1000000, 3) | MERGE (n:Label {id:i}) SET n += {prop2:"a1", prop3:"b2", prop4:"c3", prop5:"d4", prop6:"e5", prop7:"f6", prop8:"g7", prop9:"h8", prop10:"i9", prop11:"j10 q"});
    ```
    [#1115](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1115)
  - Setting properties is also improved by caching mappings of property name to
    internal property `id`. [#1147](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1147)
  - Performance has been improved for concurrent operations contending on the same
    node. [#1187](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1187)
  - When a query is executing in many iterations over the graph entities, the
    performance has been improved by 100% due to faster scanning of nodes, for example:
    ```
    UNWIND RANGE (1, 500) AS i CREATE ();
    MATCH (),(),() RETURN COUNT(*);
    ```
    [#1127](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1227)
  - The query engine is more performant as at all times it is scanning and
    expanding nodes instead of scanning both source and destination nodes and
    then expanding to the relationship between them.
    [#1085](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1085)
  - The expansion of node is no longer only done from left to right. Depending on
    the previous executions and how many relationships needed to be check on
    MERGE, the engine knows the fewest vector necessary to expand.
    [#1110](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1110)
  - The performance of `DETACH DELETE` query has been improved.
  [#1078](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1078)
- When developing [custom query modules](/custom-query-modules), node and
  relationship properties can now be changed in bulk, rather than one by one.
  [#1131](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1131)
- Changes to [the C++ API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api):
  - Users can now call `ToString()` method on `mgp::Value` and Memgraph's data
    types when writing query modules using C++ API.
    [#1140](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1140)
  - Trigger functions can now access deleted vertices from deleted edge when
    processed. [#1209](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1209)
  - When developing query modules using C++ API, you can now get the `In` and
    `Out` degrees of a node in O(1) time complexity. [#1217](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1217)
  - The C++ API now enables you to change relationship start (from) and end (to)
    nodes with `mgp::Graph.SetFrom` and `mgp::Graph.SetTo` methods.
- `SHOW INDEX INFO` now displays index information in alphabetic order for
  easier orientation. [#1178](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1178)
- The `PROFILE` query now generates a table with operators in the same order as
  in the plan constructed with the `EXPLAIN` query.
  [#1024](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1204)
- Certain queries execute faster due to the usage of custom allocators for
  [Delta
  objects](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup#write-ahead-logging).
  [#1129](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1129)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Setting a property of a node labeled `null` will no longer crash the database,
  but return an exception. [#1175](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1175)

- The [`meta` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/meta) provides a
  set of procedures for generating metadata about the database.
  [#296](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/296)
- The [`path` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/path) allows
  users to explore different paths, filter relationships, and nodes based on
  specific criteria, and achieve more complex path-related tasks that go beyond
  the capabilities of native Cypher - whether you're seeking all possible paths
  between two nodes, subgraphs that meet certain conditions, or various other
  path-oriented operations. [#313](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/313)

### Lab v2.8.2 - Sep 13, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Prepared datasets are now loaded 20-30 times faster, and 150 times faster if the
  database is in the [in-memory analytical storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#in-memory-analytical-storage-mode) on Memgraph > 2.9.
- You will be warned if your custom CYPHERL dataset import fails during the
  import process.
- After being generated, the graph schema is cached and you can always
  regenerate it.
- Run queries will now show the full roundtrip time spent on the query instead
  of just how much Memgraph spent on the query. You will still have the ability
  to see the segmentation and how much each component of query parsing,
  planning, and execution spent time on the query (also shows seconds, and
  minutes if needed, e.g. ##.## s).

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Map is now shown as expected when applying the System default Graph Style
  Script.

### Memgraph v2.10.1 - Aug 22, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Removing properties from relationships with `RemoveProperty()` function in
  [C++
  API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api).
  [#1156](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1156)
- Improved performance on batch update of properties, e.g., `MATCH (n) SET n += {prop1:1, prop2:2, ...};`
  [#1115](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1115)
- When working at a snapshot isolation level, if a certain graph object is
  changed multiple times as a part of one of many parallel transactions, the
  delta chain tracking its changes becomes very long. Other parallel transaction
  with snapshot insolation that started before the modifications and dependent
  on that object need to access and process that delta chain to get its correct
  state, which can be very expensive regarding CPU usage. Now, Memgraph is
  caching delta chains of 128 or more changes, which eliminates the need of
  processing the chain and improves performance. If you would benefit from
  changing at what length the delta chain should be cashed, adjust the value of
  the [`--delta-chain-cache-threshold` configuration
  flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#other).
  [#1124](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1124).

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- The same query module can now be executed concurrently by different clients
  without issues. [#1158](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1158)

### MAGE v1.10.0 - Aug 23, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Features and improvements </h4>}

- You can use the [`label`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/label) to check whether a
  node has the given label. [#304](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/304)
- Time zones don‚Äôt have to be difficult to work with. The [`date`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/date) provides utilities for
  date and time operations. [#291](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/291)
- The [`text` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/text) simplifies
  string concatenation and supports custom delimiters.
  [#287](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/287)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- LLM prompts returned by the [`llm_util`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/llm_util) now list node and relationship
  properties in a consistent order.
  [#324](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/324)

### Lab v2.8.1 - Aug 22, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Quick connect will now try to connect to Memgraph on `127.0.0.1` instead of
  `localhost` because it is not always clear what `localhost` will be resolved
  to.
- Paths in query results now return a correct presentation instead of an empty
  path when there is only one node in the path.
- On hard refresh of the Lab application, you are now redirected to the correct
  connection screen.
- Logs no longer scroll automatically to new log records when you scroll up to
  check past log records.

### Memgraph v2.10.1 - Aug 22, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Improvements and bug fixes </h4>}

- Improved performance on batch update of properties, e.g.:

  ```cypher
  MATCH (n) SET n += {prop1:1, prop2:2, ...};
  ```
  [#1115](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1115)
- Added a delta cache to improve query performance. This helps in situations of
  repeated reads of vertices which have many delta changes caused by another
  transaction while the current transaction is operating with snapshot isolation
  level and so needs to process those deltas. This can be tuned using
  `--delta-chain-cache-threshold`.
  [#1124](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1124)
- Concurrent access to the same query module had a race-condition on the
  pointer that was used to handle the custom memory management. A mapping has
  been added that keeps the information about what thread used what pointer to
  handle the memory resources, which should be fine since the respected query
  executions are running on a dedicated thread. Access to the mapping itself is
  thread-safe. A simple `RWLock` has been implemented here, as we shouldn't
  include `memgraph::utils` from this header and a traditional mutex might be
  overkill. A simple RAII wrapper for the mapping container has been also added
  for simpler client-side use.
  [#1158](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1158)

### Lab v2.8.0 - Aug 04, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- You can now save and edit connection details so you don't have to type them in
  on every reconnect.
- A list of recent connections is now shown in the sidebar and you can use it to
  quickly connect to any of the recent successful connections.
- When you click on a node or relationship in the Graph View, the object
  properties will be shown in a sidebar next to the Graph View rather then on
  the canvas next to the object.
- Nodes can be expanded by a double-click.
- As Memgraph now supports multi-tenant architecture, you can see the database
  you are currently working in the status bar with an option to switch to another
  database.
- Along with the number of nodes and relationships in the database, the status
  bar now also shows the number of indexes, constraints, and triggers.
- Now you can recenter, zoom in and zoom out the graph view by clicking on the
  action buttons in the bottom right corner of the Graph Results view.
- Now you can copy query results to the clipboard in JSON, CSV, or TSV format.
- You can start a name of a variable in Graph Style Script with an underscore
  `_` which is pretty handy for defining local variables in `@NodeStyle` and
  `@EdgeStyle` directives.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Setting up the `z-index` for edges in Graph Style Script now works as expected.
- Large integer numbers in query table results are now shown correctly, e.g. it
  shows `10,000,000,000,000,001` for the query `RETURN 10000000000000000 + 1`
  instead of incorrect result `10000000000000000`.
- Results now correctly show "No results" when there are no results in the query
  response, instead of a previously fetched result.
- The Lab web application is no longer unexpectedly crashing when using the
  Memgraph Platform Docker image.

### MAGE v1.9.0 - Aug 03, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Features and improvements </h4>}

- With the new [`collections` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/collections) you can
  filter, sort and modify lists within Cypher queries.
  [#284](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/284)
- The new [`map` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/map) enables manipulating
  collections of key-value pairs, and consequently advanced data operations
  within a graph database context.
  [#282](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/282)

### Memgraph v2.10.0 - Aug 2, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- The new [multi-tenant support](/configuration/multi-tenancy) available in
  the Enterprise Edition of Memgraph enables you to manage multiple isolated
  databases within a single instance. The primary objective is to facilitate
  efficient resource isolation, maintain data integrity, and manage access for
  different clients. [#952](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/952)
- The configuration flag `storage-recover-on-startup` has been deprecated and
  replaced with `data-recovery-on-startup`to support multi-tenancy.
- If you want to replace procedure names your application calls without changing
  the application code, you can define the mapping of the old and new procedure
  names in a JSON file, then set the path to the files as the value of the
  `query-callable-mappings-path` [configuration
  flag](/configuration/configuration-settings).
  [#1018](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1018)
- The [C++
  API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api)
  for writing custom query modules now enables:
  - inserting `mgp::Any` datatype into Record. [#1094](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1094)
  - comparing two `mgp::Value` variables with the `<` operator. [#1090](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1090)
  - printing the type of `mgp::Type` enumeration using the `<<` operator. For
  example, if you have a `mgp::List` list, `cout<< list <<endl` will output
  `"list"`. [#1080](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1080)
  - printing `mgp::Value` variables (except `mgp::Path`, `mgp::List` and
    `mgp::Map` types) using the `<<` operator.
    [#1127](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1127)
  - using the `mgp::Value` variables and all its subtypes (`mgp::Map`,
    `mgp::Path`, ...) inside hash structures such as `std::unordered_map` and
    `std::unordered_set`. [#1093](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1093)
  - deleting and updating map elements with `mgp::Map.Update(key, &value)`,
    `mgp::Map.Update(key, &&value)` and `mgp::Map.Erase(key)` functions.
    [#1103](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1103)
  - removing properties from nodes with `RemoveProperty()` function and labels
    with `RemoveLabel()` function.
    [#1128](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1128)
    [#1126](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1126)

  Also, the `mgp::Value` wrapper for Memgraph's data types has been extended to
  return subtypes which are modifiable (non-const).
  [#1099](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1099)
- The [C
  API](/custom-query-modules/c/c-api)
  for writing custom query modules now enables:
    - deleting and updating map elements with `mgp_map_update(map, key, value)`
  and `mgp_map_erase(map, key)` functions. [#1103](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1103)
    - removing labels from nodes with `RemoveLabel()` function.
      [#1126](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1126)
- Memgraph supports transaction timeouts defined by the Bolt protocol if the
  connection to the database is established via the [JavaScript
  client](/client-libraries/javascript).
  [#1046](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1046)
- Queries exploring all shortest paths now use considerably less memory without
  significant performance deterioration.
  [#981](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/981)
- Users with fine grained privileges will experience better performance when
  running queries due to user information cashing. Any changes to the user
  privileges will be ignored until the next login.
  [#1109](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1109)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Connection with Bolt v5.2 now works as expected when returning a path as a
  result. [#1108](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1108)
- Serializing vertex and edge properties to RocksDB now works as expected even
  when the serialization buffer is exactly 15B.
  [#1111](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1111)
- Users created in the Community Edition remain valid after the instance is
  upgraded to an Enterprise Edition. [#1067](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1067)

### Memgraph v2.9.0 - Jul 21, 2023

<Callout type="warning">

Memgraph 2.9 introduced a new configuration flag
`--replication-restore-state-on-startup` which is `false` by default.

If you want instances to remember their role and configuration in a replication
cluster upon restart, the `--replication-restore-state-on-startup` needs to be
set to `true` when first initializing the instances and remain `true` throughout
the instances' lifetime.

When reinstating a cluster it is advised to first initialize the MAIN
instance, then the REPLICA instances.

</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- The new [`ON_DISK_TRANSACTIONAL` storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage) allows you to store data on disk
  rather than in-memory. Check the implementation and implications in the
  reference guide. [#850](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/850)
- Memgraph now works with all Bolt v5.2 drivers.
  [#938](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/938)
- The [LOAD CSV clause](/data-migration/csv) has several new improvements:
  - You can now import data from web-hosted CSV files by passing the URL as a
    file location. You can also import files compressed with `gzip` or `bzip2`
    algorithms. [#1027](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1027)
  - To speed up the execution of the `LOAD CSV` clause, you can add `MATCH` and
    `MERGE` entities prior to reading the rows from a CSV file. But, the `MATCH`
    or `MERGE` clause has to return just one row or Memgraph will throw an
    exception. [#916](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/916)
  - If a certain sequence of characters in a CSV file needs to be imported as
    null, you can now specify them with the NULLIF option of the LOAD CSV
    clause. [#914](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/914)
- You can now use `mgp::Type::Any` while developing a custom query procedure
  with [the C++
  API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api)
  to specify that the argument of the procedure can be of any type.
  [#982](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/982)
- When you need to differentiate transactions, you can now define and pass
  [transaction metadata](/fundamentals/transactions) via the client and check it in Memgraph by running the
  `SHOW TRANSACTIONS;` query.
  [#945](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/945)
- You can now create [custom batch procedures in Python and
  C++](/custom-query-modules)
  that process data in batches, thus consuming less memory.
[#964](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/964)
- The [`ANALYZE GRAPH;` query](/fundamentals/indexes#analyze-graph) now includes information about the degree of all
  nodes to enhance the MERGE optimizations on supernodes.
  [#1026](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1026)
- The `--replication-restore-state-on-startup` configuration flag allows you to
  define whether instances in the [replication
  cluster](/configuration/replication) will regain their roles upon restart
  (`true`) or restart as disconnected "blank" MAIN instances (default setting
  `false`). This flag resolved the unwanted behavior of restarted REPLICA
  instances disconnecting from the cluster, but it also needs to be introduced
  to MAIN instances so they are not disconnected from the cluster upon restart.
  [#791](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/791)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- `init-file` and `init-data-file` configuration flags allow the execution of
  queries from a CYPHERL file, prior to or immediately after the Bolt server
  starts and are now possible to configure in the Community Edition as well.
  [#850](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/850)
- The IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL storage mode now deallocates memory as expected and
  no longer consumes memory excessively. [#1025](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1025)
- When no values are returned from a map, a null is returned instead of an
  exception occurring. [#1039](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/1039)

### MAGE v1.8.0 - Jul 21, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Features and improvements </h4>}

- With the [`llm_util` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/llm_util) you can generate a graph schema in a format best
  suited for large language models (LLMs).
  [#225](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/225)
- When executing complex queries, the [`periodic`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/periodic) allows batching results from one query
  into another to improve execution time.
  [#221](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/221)
- The [`do`
  module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/do) which allows the
  execution of different queries depending on certain conditions being met, has
  been rewritten from Python to C++ to improve performance and it can also
  periodically iterates. [#222](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/222)
- The [`migrate` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/migrate) has the option to get data from MySQL, SQL server, or
  Oracle DB to migrate it to Memgraph.
  [#209](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/209)

### Lab v2.7.1 - Jul 05, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Improvements </h4>}

- System Default style has been renamed to System Style.
- If you run a query that has errors in the Graph Style Script code, you can
  decide to run it using the System Style.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Bug that would allow multiple styles to be the default has been fixed.
- The System Default Style now has `background-color` set to white.
- Queries selected in the Query Editor now execute as expected.
- Creating and editing a query module as well as selecting a transformation
  module in the Streams section now work as expected.
- All links are now linked with appropriate external resources.
- The pop-up window in the Run History that allows rerunning the query now
  closes once an option is selected.

### Lab v2.7.0 - Jun 28, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> What's new </h4>}

- Now you can adjust the following settings:
  - Code completion and automatic graph rendering limits
  - The capacity of run history and its clearing
  - The limit for visible logs

  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/settings.png)
- The new interfaces for managing saved styles enables searching and changing
  the default style in the Lab. The saved styles now also have a preview.
  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/styles.png)
- The run history now also tracks changes to the query, style, or both. You can
  also filter out records to show All (both queries runs and applied styles),
  Query history (only query runs), and Style history (only applied style
  changes). You can expand both the query and style to see the full Cypher or
  GSS code.
  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/run_history.png)
  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/run_history_expand.png)
  ![](/pages/release-notes/lab-270/run_history_queries.png)
- Queries inside a collection can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on their
  name.
- When testing and trying out different functions in the GSS you can use
  single-line (`// comment`) and multi-line (`/* comment */`) comments in the
  GSS code editor without losing previous state.
- Change the canvas color of the graph view with the new property
  `background-color` in [`@ViewStyle`](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/directive-properties).
- Change the stack order of how nodes and edges are rendered in the graph view
  with the property `z-index` in
  [`@NodeStyle`](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/directive-properties) and
  [`@EdgeStyle`](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/directive-properties) directives. It works
  the same as the CSS z-index property.
- Set up transparent colors with the [new GSS
  functions](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/built-in-elements) `RGBA` and `HSLA`. You can also get
  the transparency value with the function `Alpha`.
- [New functions](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/built-in-elements) allow more customizations: `Sort`, `Coalesce`, `Reverse`,
  `IsMap`, `AsMap`, `Execute`, `Get`, `Set`, `Del`, `MapKeys`, `MapValues`,
  `AsIterator`, `IsIterator`, `Next`
- [Global and local
    variables](/data-visualization/graph-style-script#caching-results-for-faster-performance)
    make developing new styles easier:
  - Variable graph is now available outside `@NodeStyle` and `@EdgeStyle`
    context
  - Local variables can be defined with `Define` within `@NodeStyle` and
    `@EdgeStyle` context
- Memgraph Lab is now packaged as an RPM package and arm64 (M1 chip) for MacOS.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Running a selected part of the Cypher query would just place that selected
  part in the run history. Now, the full query will be saved in the run history,
  and on its run, only the selected part will be executed again.
- Rows that would hide when scrolling the data results view now preview as expected.
- The System Default style colors all the nodes with the same label with a
  unique color.
- When showing a graph view on a map, you will no longer see a progress
  percentage which is unnecessary as each node has a fixed and known position
  due to its latitude and longitude values.
- All tables across the Lab are responsive as expected.
- Layouts no longer cause memory leaks and work as expected.
- By fixing a bug, you can now successfully connect to Memgraph using a hostname
  that contains numbers in the top-level domain.
- Markdown lists in query descriptions are indented as expected.

### Memgraph v2.8.0 - May 18, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- Data recovery is now up to 6x faster depending on the number of available
  cores, as [snapshot loading is distributed among several
  threads](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup#snapshots).
  [#868](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/868)
- During the recovery, indexes can also  be created using multiple threads, thus
  speeding up the process. [#882](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/882)
- In the Enterprise Edition, Memgraph now [exposes system
  metrics](/configuration/monitoring-server) via an HTTP endpoint, so
  you can get information about transactions, query latency and various other
  properties. [#940](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/940)
- It‚Äôs now possible to use the [map projection
  syntax](/fundamentals/data-types#maps) to create maps. Map
  projections are convenient for building maps based on existing values and they
  are used by data access tools like GraphQL.
  [#892](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/892)
- You can now check if [the data directory](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup) is
  (un)locked with the `DATA DIRECTORY LOCK STATUS;` query.
  [#933](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/933)
- You can now check the current [storage
  mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage) and [isolation
  levels](/fundamentals/transactions) by running the `SHOW STORAGE INFO;`
  query. [#883](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/883)
- Check the suspected [build type of the Memgraph
  executable](/configuration/server-stats#build-information) by
  running the `SHOW BUILD INFO;` query.
  [#894](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/894)
- Performance has been improved by optimizing the deallocation of resources in
  Memgraph's custom `PoolResource` memory allocator.
  [#898](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/898)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- Running Python procedures now consume less memory.
  [#932](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/932)
- Memory allocation in LOAD CSV queries has been optimized to avoid performance
  degradation. [#877](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/877)
- Query profiles of the LOAD CSV queries now show the correct values of memory
  usage. [#885](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/885)

### Lab v2.6.0 - Apr 20, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> What's new </h4>}

- If you execute multiple Cypher queries, you can now view the result of each
  query instead of viewing just the last result.
  ![results](/pages/release-notes/lab-260/results.png)
- Besides exporting query results to JSON, you can also export them to CSV and
  TSV file format.
  ![download](/pages/release-notes/lab-260/download.png)
- If the dataset contains millions or billions nodes and relationships, their
  count in the status bar will be in the following format: X.XXM or X.XXB.
- Syntax of code blocks in the query collection description can now be
  highlighted by using one of the following language
  styles:¬†`cypher`,¬†`bash`,¬†`python`,¬†`css`,¬†`c`,¬†`cpp`,¬†`json`,¬†`sql`,
  and¬†`yaml`. Check the examples of syntax highlighting in the¬†[Markdown
  Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting).
  ![markdown](/pages/release-notes/lab-260/markdown.png)
- [New functions of the Graph Style Script
  language](/data-visualization/graph-style-script/built-in-elements) used for customizing graph appearance
  are: `Reduce`, `Sum`, `Avg`, `Min`, `Max`, `IsArray`, `Hue`, `Saturation`,
  `Lightness`, `HSL`.
  ![gss](/pages/release-notes/lab-260/gss.png)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- The initial node count has been removed from the connection initialization so
  connecting to the Memgraph instance containing a huge number of nodes will no
  longer cause a timeout.
- Run History now logs queries as expected.
- When switching between the map view and the default view the graph view no
  longer becomes unresponsive.
- Using a new line character `\n` in the query module doesn‚Äôt result in a new
  line, but an explicit character `\n`.
- Viewing the code of multiple query modules in the split screen now
  works as expected.
- Notifications no longer mix with the Query Editor and Query Collections visual
  elements.
- Pressing CMD/CTRL + S will save a query within a query collection execution section as intended.
- The autosave in query collection is now triggered on every query run as it was
  intended.
- Running a selected portion of the query won‚Äôt remove the rest of the query
  from the query collection execution view.
- GSS `Blue` function was returning a wrong number. It is fixed now. `Lighter`
  and `Darker` functions now work correctly as well because they were depending
  on the output from the `Blue` function.

### Memgraph v2.7.0 - Apr 5, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> New features and improvements </h4>}

- You can now choose between [two different storage modes](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage):
  - Transactional mode - the default database mode that favors
    strongly-consistent ACID transactions using WAL files and periodic
    snapshots, but requires more time and resources during data import and
    analysis.
  - Analytical mode - speeds up import and data analysis but offers no ACID
    guarantees besides manually created snapshots.
  Switch between modes within the session using the `STORAGE MODE
  IN_MEMORY_{TRANSACTIONAL|ANALYTICAL};` query. [#772](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/772)
- You can now call [subqueries](/querying/clauses/call) inside existing queries using the CALL clause.
  [#794](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/794)
- When you want to filter data using properties that all have label:property
  indexes set, you can make Memgraph analyze the properties on all or several
  labels with the [`ANALYZE GRAPH;`
  query](/fundamentals/indexes#analyze-graph). By calculating the
  distribution of property values, Memgraph will be able to select the optimal
  index for the query and it will execute faster.
  [#812](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/812)
- If, for example, you are no longer interested in the results of the query you
  ran, or the procedure you built is running in an infinite loop, you can [stop
  the transaction](/fundamentals/transactions#managing-transactions)
  with the `TERMINATE TRANSACTIONS tid;` query; Find out the transaction ID with
  `SHOW TRANSACTIONS;` query.
  [#790](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/790)
- With the [new flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#other)
  `password-encryption-algorithm` you can choose between `bcrypt`, `sha256`, and
  `sha256-multiple` encryption algorithms. SHA256 offers better performance
  compared to the more secure but less performant bcrypt.
  [#839](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/839)
- Import using the [LOAD CSV clause](/data-migration/csv) has
  been further improved by using a memory allocator which will reuse memory
  blocks allocated while processing the `LOAD CSV` query.
  [#825](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/825)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

- The users who have [global visibility on the
  graph](/configuration/security#label-based-access-control) will
  experience a slight improvement in performance regarding label-based access
  control as the engine no longer check privileges for each node.
  [#837](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/837)
- The [All shortest paths
  algorithm](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal#all-shortest-paths)
  now supports multiedges. [#832](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/832)

### MAGE v1.7.0 - Apr 5, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Features and improvements </h4>}

- The [new conditional execution
module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/do) lets you define
  conditions not expressible in Cypher and and use them to control query
  execution. [#203](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/203)

### MAGE v1.6.1 - Mar 20, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Features and improvements </h4>}

- With the `export_util.csv_query()` procedure, you can export query results to a CSV file or as a stream. [#199](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/199)
- Similarity algorithms (`jaccard`, `overlap` and `cosine`) have been rewritten in C++ to improve performance. [#196](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/196)

### Lab v2.5.0 - Mar 17, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> What's New </h4>}

* If there are several Cypher queries in the query editor you can select a single query and run
  it without commenting out all the other queries.

![run-selected-query-in-the-lab](/pages/release-notes/lab-250/lab-run-selected-demo.gif)

* You can now open multiple query executions views side by side and compare query execution speed or results.

![multiple-query-executions-in-the-lab](/pages/release-notes/lab-250/lab-multiple-editors-demo.gif)

* Query modules are now sorted alphabetically for easier and faster browsing. A search box has also been added to query modules with more
  than 5 procedures to help narrow them down (e.g. `nxalg` query module has [49 procedures](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/nxalg)).
* When rendering a graph with more than 3,500 nodes or 8,500 relationships, which might take considerable amount of time to preview, you will be
  asked if you want to proceed with the graph visualization or switch to the data view.
* Besides manually saving changes in the Cypher query and GSS style editor in the query collections section, they will also be saved
  automatically after each query run.
* Memgraph Lab will now notify you of any product updates and offer various tips and tricks for using the Memgraph ecosystem.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

* Cypher code suggestions can now handle labels and properties of 250k nodes and 500k relationships, compared to the previous limit of
  100k nodes and 200k relationships.
* Multiple scrollable elements of the query collections was making scrolling difficult. Now you can focus on a particular element and
  scroll through it by clicking on it.
* Browser's back button is now working as expected when using Lab as a web application.
* Data in the query results, query modules and query run history tables now loads faster making the scrolling smoother and improving
  the user experience.
* Graph schema is now generated even if the database has no relationships.
* In-progress feedback when generating graph schema and exporting datasets for graphs with more than 10M nodes
  is now previewed as expected.
* A scrolling issue with expanded results in the Data view where you couldn't see a completely expanded row because the
  scroll would jump to the next row is now fixed.
* Dataset cards no longer spread apart when conducting a search.

### Memgraph v2.6.0 - Mar 07, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major features and improvements </h4>}

- Importing speed using the LOAD CSV clause has been improved due to two changes:
  -  Performance improvement in accessing values from large arrays or maps with numerous properties. [#744](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/774)
  -  Upon creating a large number of node or relationship properties, properties are stored in a property store all at once, instead of individually. [#788](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/788)
- Newly implemented `exists()` function allows using patterns as part of the filtering clause. Check the [Cypher Manual](/querying/clauses/where) for usage. [#818](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/818)
- With the new [Python mock query module API](/custom-query-modules/python/mock-python-api), you can now develop and test Python query modules for Memgraph without having to run a Memgraph instance. The mock API is compatible with the Python API and thus developed modules can be added to Memgraph as-is. [#757](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/757)
- Memgraph now supports Fedora 36 and Ubuntu 22.04 for ARM. [#787](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/787) [#810](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/810)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug fixes </h4>}

-  `torch` and `igraph` can no longer be removed from the `svs.modules` cache to avoid issues after reload. [#720](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/720)
-  Newly created nodes now comply with the set label based authorization rules. [#755](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/755)
-  Constructing LocalDateTime objects with invalid parameters doesn‚Äôt crash Memgraph anymore, but throws an informative exception. [#819](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/819)
-  Error message warning about incompatible `epoch_id` between a MAIN and REPLICA instance has been improved. [#786](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/786)

### MAGE v1.6.0 - Jan 30, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- The `setup` script now halts if the build fails on C++ or Rust side. [#194](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/194)
- With the [`meta_util.schema()` procedure](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/meta_util), you can generate a graph schema as a graph result. [#187](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/187)
- The execution of the `single` method multiple times has been improved by rewriting [the distance calculator](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/distance_calculator) from Python to C++. [#191](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/191)
- [Dynamic graph analytics](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/betweenness_centrality_online) have been ported to C++ to improve performance. [#182](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/182)
- [New module `elastic_search_serialization`](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/elasticsearch_synchronization) enables developers to serialize Memgraph into Elasticsearch instance using basic authentication. [#170](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/170)

### Memgraph v2.5.2 - Jan 26, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Variables can be used inside nested [FOREACH clauses](/querying/clauses). [#725](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/725)
- [FOREACH clause](/querying/clauses) can now use indexes if needed (e.g. in case of MERGE). [#736](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/736)
- [C++ API](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api) now allows setting and getting node and relationship properties. [#732](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/732)
- [OPTIONAL MATCH](/querying/clauses/optional-match) can now use label property indexes that are referencing the previously matched variables. [#736](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/736)
- Iterating over all relationships in a graph now works as expected, as well as checking whether the graph contains a given relationship. [#743](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/743)
- Implementation of the [All Shortest Paths algorithm](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal#all-shortest-paths) was fixed so the paths are no longer duplicated when the upper bound is used. [#737](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/737)

### MAGE v1.5.1 - Jan 20, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- The version of MemgraphDB that will be used in the Docker image has been updated to 2.5.1.
  [#193](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/193)

### Memgraph v2.5.1 - Jan 19, 2023

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- The LOAD CSV clause now uses less RAM to load a whole CSV file. Modification
  made to improve the LOAD CSV operation, also influenced high memory usage
  operations with objects such as lists and map. Modifying or accessing elements
  inside those objects now also uses less RAM.
  [#712](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/712)
- The logic of the `read_write_type_checker` was corrected so queries now get
  the right `rw_type`, making the replication system work as expected.
  [#709](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/709)
- Bolt protocol has been improved by adding the server-assigned query ID (`qid`)
  as part of the transactions' metadata.
  [#721](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/721)
- Fixed a trigger bug that would cause an error if Memgraph is configured to run
  without properties on edges. As a result of the fiy, triggers are now working
  as expected when there are no properties on edges.
  [#717](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/717)

### MAGE v1.5.0 - Dec 20, 2022

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Now you can find ancestors (all the nodes from which a path exists ) and descendants (all nodes to which a path exists) starting from a certain node, sort directed acyclic graph in a way that a node which appears before others is first, return a subgraph from nodes using `connect_nodes` method, and create relationships between nodes in a list using the `chain_nodes` method.
  [#180](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/180)
- C++ API is now aligned with Memgraph 2.5
  [#184](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/184)
- Graph Coloring no longer outputs strings but vertices and integers. This allows you to use the result of graph coloring directly in Memgraph Lab.
  [#177](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/177)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}
- By enabling module reset, you can now train and evaluate the model without shutting down the database.
  Class labels can now start from 0 or negative numbers.
  The low limit of the early stopping flag no longer prematurely stops the training of the model while running the Node classification module.
  [#173](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/pull/173)

### Memgraph v2.5.0 - Dec 13, 2022

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- `DISTINCT` operator can now be used with aggregation functions. Until now, if
  you wanted to use an aggregation function with distinct values, you had to
  write a query similar to this one `WITH DISTINCT n.prop as distinct_prop
  RETURN COUNT(distinct_prop)`. Now you can use the `DISTINCT` operator like in
  the following query, `RETURN COUNT(DISTINCT n.prop)`.
  [#654](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/665)
- You can now create a user before the Bolt server starts using the environment
  variables `MEMGRAPH_USER` for the username, `MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD` for the
  password and `MEMGRAPH_PASSFILE` file that contains username and password for
  creating the user in the following format: `username:password`.
  [#696](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/696)
- With the new configuration flag `init_file` you can execute queries from the
  CYPHERL file which need to be executed before the Bolt server starts and with
  the configuration flag `init_data_file` you can execute queries from the
  CYPHERL file immediately after the Bolt server starts.
  [#696](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/696)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Constructors and assignment operators in the C++ query modules API now work as
  expected, and the API type check in the `ValueNumeric` method now correctly
  recognizes numeric types.
  [#688](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/688)
- Error message support (`SetErrorMessage`) has been added to query methods that
  use the MAGE C++ API. [#688](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/688)
- The `EmptyResult` sink operator was added to the Memgraph's planner. This
means that results produced by a query `MATCH (n) SET n.test_prop = 2` will get
exhausted which was a problem in some Bolt clients implementations, e.g in
Golang's client. [#667](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/667)
- Fixed Python submodules reloading when calling `CALL mg.load()` and `CALL
  mg.load_all()`. Before, only the Python module would be reloaded, but now all
  dependencies get reloaded as well. This includes Python's utility submodules
  and Python packages, which means that the environment with Python packages can
  be changed without turning off the database.
  [#653](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/653)

### Lab v2.4.0 - Dec 2, 2022

{<h4 className="custom-header"> What's New </h4>}

* Memgraph Lab now supports manual transaction workflows you can construct using transaction commands `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
* Cypher intellisense has been updated to suggest new Cypher features from Memgraph 2.4.0 such as:
  * Privileges for user-role authorization.
  * Commands and privileges for label-based authorization.
  * Manual transaction commands: `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.
  * Checking configuration with `SHOW CONFIG`.
  * All shortest path algorithm `allShortest`.
  * Graph projection function `project`.
  * Additional query module signature that accepts a projected graph as an optional first argument.
* Graph results view will check for nodes and relationships in arrays and projected graphs. It simplifies
  the visualization of a projected graph or an array of nodes/relationships without using `UNWIND`.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

* Once the table results view is selected, the results of the following query run will also preview in the table results view, instead of automatically switching to the graph view.
* Exploring a dataset's query collection now works as expected. It opens up a list of queries that can be used to explore the dataset.
* Failed queries from the rich collections now return a detailed error message.
* _Save code changes_ button in rich collections will now be enabled only if there are unsaved changes for the Cypher query
  or GSS.
* A bug that would only show the first node label instead of all node labels in the table results view has been fixed.

### MAGE v1.4.0 - Nov 15, 2022

### Lab v2.3.1 - Nov 4, 2022

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

* Writing a single-line comment in the Cypher code no longer results in an error.
* Having different map tiles (e.g. "light" map tile on one map view, but "dark" map tile on another map view) for multiple graph map views in the rich collection is enabled and works as expected.
* Graph rendering freeze when toggling the map view on/off during the graph rendering process has been fixed.
* All the information about nodes and edges on the graph schema is now previewed as expected.
* A bug that would mix query title and description when queries are reordered in the rich query collection has been fixed.

* Saving a new style now works as expected. The active style is saved, not the last applied one.

### Lab v2.3.0 - Oct 24, 2022

{<h4 className="custom-header"> What's New </h4>}

* Add new updates to the prepared datasets:
  * Add a search bar for searching and filtering datasets.
  * Add featured (highlighted) datasets.
  * Add rich collections with prepared queries, descriptions, and GSS for each dataset.
* Add new updates to the latest queries:
  * Change the name from "Latest queries" to "Run history" because it contains both queries and GSS changes.
  * Show GSS changes in the "Run history" section.
* Replace previous collections with "Rich collections":
  * Add more context to each collected query: title, markdown description, Cypher query, and GSS.
  * Add the ability to run multiple query executions within the query collection.
  * Add import and export functionality of a collection.
* Add a new version of GSS:
  * Add new GSS directive `@ViewStyle` to configure physics, link distance, repel force, and view type (`default` or `map`).
  * Add new GSS directive `@ViewStyle.Map` to configure map tiles for map view.
  * Add new GSS functions: `Slice`, `Split`, `Replace`, `Trim`, `Nodes`, `Edges`, `IsNumber`, `IsBoolean`, `IsString`, `IsNull`.
  * Add new GSS node properties `latitude` and `longitude` used to define the latitude and longitude of each node for the map view.
* Integrate graph visualization library `orb`.
* Add the ability to enable/disable map background view for nodes with geo information.
* Add the ability to connect to Neo4j, load datasets, and run Cypher queries.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

* Fix map view to use latitude and longitude from GSS style instead of `lat` and `lng` node properties.
* Fix the default GSS to match new the map view configuration by checking `lat` and `lng` node properties.

  passing user's instead of role's `fine_grained_access_handler`.
  [#579](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/579)

### Memgraph v2.4.0 - Sep 15, 2022

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Add replica state to `SHOW REPLICAS` query.
  [#379](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/379)
- Add `current_timestamp` and `number_of_timestamp_behind_master` to `SHOW
  REPLICAS` query. [#412](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/412)
- Query `REGISTER REPLICA replica_name SYNC` no longer supports `TIMEOUT`
  parameter. To mimic the previous behavior of `REGISTER REPLICA replica_name
  SYNC WITH TIMEOUT 1`, one should use `REGISTER REPLICA replica_name ASYNC`
  instead. [#423](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/423)
- Make behavior more [openCypher](http://opencypher.org/) compliant regarding
  checking against `NULL` values is `CASE` expressions.
  [#432](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/432)
- Previously registered replicas are automatically registered on restart of
  Memgraph. [#415](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/415)
- Add new command `SHOW CONFIG` that returns the configuration of the currently
  running Memgraph instance.
  [#459](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/459)
- Extend the shortest paths functionality with [All Shortest
  Path](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal#all-shortest-paths)
  query. [#409](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/409)
- Extend the query modules C and Python API to enable logging on different
  levels. [#417](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/417)
- Added C++ query modules API. Instead of using the C API call, C++ API calls
  significantly simplify the implementation of fast query modules.
  [#546](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/546)
- [Enterprise] Added support for label-based authorization. In addition to
  clause-based authorization rules, each user can now be granted `NOTHING`,
  `READ`, `UPDATE`, or `CREATE_DELETE` permission on a given label or edge
  type. [#484](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/484)
- New Cypher function `project()` creates a projected graph consisting of nodes
  and edges from aggregated paths. Any query module or algorithm can be now run
  on a subgraph, by passing the variable of the projected graph as the first
  argument of the query module procedure. [#535](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/535)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Added a check to ensure two replicas cannot be registered to an identical
  end-point. [#406](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/406)
- `toString` function is now able to accept `Date`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`
  and `Duration` data types.
  [#429](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/429)
- Aggregation functions now return the openCypher-compliant results on `null`
  input and display the correct behavior when grouped with other operators.
  [#448](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/448)
- Corrected inconsistencies and incorrect behavior with regards to sync
  replicas. For more detail about the behavior, please check [Under the
  hood view on replication](/configuration/replication).
  [#435](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/435)
- Fixed handling `ROUTE` Bolt message. Memgraph didn't handle the fields of
  `ROUTE` message properly. Therefore the session might be stuck in a state
  where even the `RESET` message did not help. With this fix, sending a `RESET`
  message will properly reset the session.
  [#475](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/475)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added support for compilation on ARM architectures (aarch64) and Docker
  support for running Memgraph on Apple M1 machines.
  [#340](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/340)
- Added [monitoring server](/configuration/monitoring-server) that forwards
  certain information from Memgraph to the clients connected to it (e.g. logs)
  using WebSocket. [#337](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/337)
- Added `CONFIGS` and `CREDENTIALS` options to [Kafka streams](/data-streams).
  [#328](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/328)
- Added [built-in procedures used for handling Python module
  files](/custom-query-modules/manage-query-modules).
  `mg.create_module_file`, `mg.update_module_file`, `mg.delete_module_file`,
  `mg.get_module_file`, and `mg.get_module_files` allow you to do modifications
  on your Python module files, get their content, and list all the files present
  in your query module directories directly from Memgraph.
  [#330](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/330)
- Built-in procedures
  [`mg.procedures`](/custom-query-modules/manage-query-modules#utility-query-module) and
  [`mg.transformations`](/data-streams/transformation-modules#utility-procedures-for-transformations)
  return additional information about the procedures and transformations
  scripts. `path` returns an absolute path to the module file containing the
  procedure, while `is_editable` returns `true` if the file can be edited using
  Memgraph or `false` otherwise.
  [#310](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/310)
- [Added `SHOW VERSION` query](/configuration/server-stats) that returns the version of the Memgraph server
  which is being queried. [#265](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/265)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- The reference count is increased when `Py_None` is returned from the `_mgp`
  module. This fixes a nondeterministic fatal Python error.

- Use correct error when printing warning in rebalance callback of Kafka
  consumer. [#321](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/321)
- Fix transaction handling in streams in case of serialization error.
  Previously, a serialization error caused an exception to be thrown since
  nested transactions are not supported. After this fix, the transactions are
  handled correctly in the transaction retry logic.
  [#339](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/339)
- Temporal types `LocalTime` and `LocalDateTime` instantiations return subsecond
  precision. Additionally, query modules `mg_local_date_time_now()` and
  `mg_local_time_now()` also return subsecond precision.
  [#333](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/333)

### Memgraph v2.1.1 - Dec 07, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking Changes </h4>}

- Loading streams created by versions of Memgraph older than 2.1 is not
  possible. We suggest you extract the necessary information using the older
  version of Memgraph and recreate the streams in a newer version (Memgraph 2.1
  and newer).

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added procedures for retrieving configuration information specific for each
  stream type. `mg.pulsar_stream_info` will return information about a specific
  Pulsar stream and `mg.kafka_stream_info` will return information about a
  specific Kafka stream. [#301](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/301)
- `SHOW STREAMS` now returns default values for batch interval and batch size if
  they weren't specified. [#306](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/306)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Query execution stats, returned after a Cypher query was executed, are now
  updated with the changes made in write procedures.
  [#304](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/304)
- Loading streams created by older versions won't cause Memgraph to crash.
  [#302](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/302)

### Lab v1.3.6 - Dec 3, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

* Fix the bug when returning edges: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')`.

### Memgraph v2.1.0 - Nov 22, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking Changes </h4>}

- Loading streams created by older versions cause Memgraph to crash. The only
  possible workaround involves **deleting the existing streams**.
  The streams can be deleted by the `DROP STREAM` query in the old versions of
  Memgraph. After upgrading to this version, the `streams` directory has to be
  deleted manually from Memgraph's data directory (on Debian-based systems, it
  is `/var/lib/memgraph` by default).
- The query for creating a Kafka stream now requires the `KAFKA` keyword. The
  previous form `CREATE STREAM ...` was changed to `CREATE KAFKA STREAM ...`.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Now supporting Bolt protocol version 4.3.
  [#226](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/226)
- Streams support for retrying conflicting transactions. When a message is
  processed from a certain stream source, a query is executed as a part of the
  transaction. If that transaction fails because of other conflicting
  transactions, the transaction is retried a set number of times. The number of
  retries and interval between each retry can be controlled with configs
  `--stream-transaction-conflict-retries` and
  `--stream-transaction-retry-interval`.
  [#294](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/294)
- Added procedure to configure the starting offset (to consume messages from) of
  a topic (and its partitions).
  [#282](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/282)
- Added `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` option to `CREATE KAFKA STREAM` which you can check
  [here](/data-streams).
  [#282](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/282)
- Added Bolt notifications in the query summary to inform the user about results
  or to give useful tips. When a query executes successfully, sometimes is
  necessary to give users tips or extra information about the execution.
  [#285](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/285)
- Added execution statistics in the query summary to inform user on how many
  objects were affected. E.g., when you run a query with a `CREATE` clause,
  you'll know how many nodes/edges were created by it.
  [#285](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/285)
- Added support for connecting to Pulsar as a new stream source. For more
  details, check out our [reference pages](/data-streams).
  [#293](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/293)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Allow duration values to be used as weights in the [Weighted Shortest
  Path](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal#weighted-shortest-path)
  query. [#278](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/278)
- Fix linkage error when `mgp_local_time_get_minute` is used.
  [#273](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/273)
- Fix crash when temporal types are used with `ORDER BY` clause.
  [#299](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/299)

### Lab v1.3.5 - Nov 17, 2021

- Fixed the action of exporting the database to a `cypherl` file.
- Added support for the temporal types in query responses.

### Memgraph v2.0.1 - Oct 12, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Updated a startup message with a link to the [getting started
  page](/getting-started).
  [#259](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/259)

  documentation explaining the problem in more detail.
  [#243](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/243)
- Updated mgconsole to
  [v1.1.0](https://github.com/memgraph/mgconsole/releases/tag/v1.1.0).
  [#260](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/260)

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Graph updates made in the write procedures are now correctly registered in the
  triggers. [#262](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/262)
- Fixed `DETACH DELETE` interaction with the triggers. Previously, vertices
  deleted by the `DETACH DELETE` would not be registered by triggers if only `ON () DELETE` trigger existed.
  [#266](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/pull/266)

### Memgraph v2.0.0 - Oct 5, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking Changes </h4>}

- Changed the `timestamp()` function to return `microseconds` instead of
  `milliseconds`.
- Most of the query modules C API functions are changed to return a `mgp_error`
  as a more fine-grained way of error reporting. The only exceptions are the
  functions that free allocated memory (`mgp_free` and `mgp_global_free`) and
  destroy objects (`mgp_value_destroy`, `mgp_list_destroy`, etc.) which
  remain the same.
- The first user created using the `CREATE USER` query will have all the
  privileges granted to him. Previously, you could've locked yourself out of
  Memgraph by creating a user and immediately disconnecting.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added support for temporal types, a feature that allows the user to manipulate
  and store time related data in the graph. For more information take a look at
  the [reference guide](/fundamentals/data-types)
- Added support for parameters with `CREATE` clause in the following form:
  `CREATE (n $param)`.
- Introduced settings to Memgraph that can be modified during runtime. You can
  check out more details [here](/configuration/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).
- Added writeable procedure support, so
  [procedures](/custom-query-modules/python/python-example)
  can modify the graph by creating and deleting vertices and edges, modifying
  the labels of vertices or setting the properties of vertices and edges.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Fixed planning of queries with `MERGE` clause. If a previously defined symbol
  is used as property value inside the `MERGE` clause, the planner will
  correctly use the label-property index if present.
- Unused memory is correctly returned to OS when `FREE MEMORY` query is used.
  Before, Memgraph would free up the memory internally and not return it to the
  OS. Because of that Memgraph could allocate more memory from the OS than it's
  allowed.
- Fixed recovery from durability files. Because of a wrong check, Memgraph could
  crash and leave the durability files in an invalid state making recovery not
  possible.
- Fixed usage of `execute` keyword in queries. Because of the special way we
  handle the `EXECUTE` keyword from the `CREATE TRIGGER` query using that same
  keyword in other contexts caused Memgraph to crash.

### Lab v1.3.2 - Oct 5, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Fixed the copy to clipboard bug with removed spaces.
- Updated the Cypher IntelliSense with the latest commands.

### Lab v1.3.1 - Sep 27, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Signed the Memgraph Lab applications for macOS and Windows.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Fixed the paste overwrite action in the query editor.
- Fixed the bug `Cannot read property 'class' of null`.

### Memgraph v1.6.1 - Jul 24, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added proper privilege checks for queries executed by triggers and stream
  transformations.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Fixed error handling in streams to make restarting streams possible after
  failing. The issue is caused by not rolling back the transaction in which the
  query failed, so when the stream was restarted and tried to process the next
  batch of messages it was still in a transaction, but it tried to start a new
  one. Now the transaction is rolled back in case of any errors during query
  execution, so a new transaction can be started during the processing of the
  next batch of messages.

### Memgraph v1.6.0 - Jul 7, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking Changes </h4>}

- Changed the `LOCK_PATH` permission to `DURABILITY`.


{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added support for consuming Kafka streams. You can connect Memgraph to a Kafka
  cluster and run queries based on the messages received. The transformation
  from Kafka to Cypher queries is done using **Transformation Modules**, a
  concept similar to Query Modules. Using our Python and C API, you can easily
  define functions that analyze Kafka messages and generate different queries
  based on them. The stream connection can be configured, tested, stopped,
  started, checked, and dropped.
- Introduced global allocators for Query Modules using C API, so the data can be
  preserved between multiple runs of the same procedure.
- Introduced new isolation levels, `READ COMMITTED` and `READ_UNCOMMITTED`. The
  isolation level can be set with a config. Also, you can set the isolation
  level for a certain session or the next transaction. The names of the
  isolation levels should be self-explanatory, unlike the `SNAPSHOT ISOLATION`
  which is still the default isolation level.
- The query timeouts are now triggered using a different method. Before, we used
  the TSC to measure the execution time. Unfortunately, this proved unreliable
  for certain CPUs (AMD Ryzen 7 and M1), which caused queries to timeout almost
  instantly. We switched to POSIX timer which **should** work on every hardware,
  while not affecting the performance.
- Added a config, `allow-load-csv`, with which you can disable `LOAD CSV`
  clause. `LOAD CSV` can read and display data from any file on the system which
  could be insecure for some systems. Because of that, we added a config that
  allows you to disable that clause in every case.
- Added `CREATE SNAPSHOT` query. Snapshots are created every few minutes, using
  this query you can trigger snapshot creation instantly.
- Increased the default query timeout to 10 minutes. The previous default amount
  of 3 minutes proved too small, especially for queries that use `LOAD CSV` with
  a large dataset.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Fixed parsing of certain types in Query Modules using Python API.
- Fixed a concurrency bug for Query Modules using Python API. Running the same
  procedure from multiple clients caused the Memgraph instance to crash.
- Fixed restoring triggers that call procedures. Because the triggers were
  restored before the procedures, the query trigger executes couldn't find the
  called procedure, which caused the restore to fail. Switching up the order was
  enough to fix the problem.

### Memgraph v1.5.0 - May 28, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added database triggers. You can now create, delete, and print out triggers
  that execute Cypher statements. You can create custom actions whenever a node
  or an edge is created, updated, or deleted. All the triggers are persisted on
  the disk, so no information is lost between runs.
- Replaced mg_client with the mgconsole command-line interface, which ships
  directly with Memgraph. You can now install mgconsole directly on Windows and
  macOS.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Fixed parsing of types for Python procedures for types nested in `mgp. List`.
  For example, parsing of `mgp.List[mgp.Map]` works now.
- Fixed memory tracking issues. Some of the allocation and deallocation wasn't
  tracked during the query execution.
- Fixed reading CSV files that are using CRLF as the newline symbol.
- Fixed permission issues for `LOAD CSV`, `FREE MEMORY`, `LOCK DATA DIRECTORY`,
  and replication queries.

### Memgraph v1.4.0 - Apr 2, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking Changes </h4>}

- Changed `MEMORY LIMIT num (KB|MB)` clause in the procedure calls to `PROCEDURE MEMORY LIMIT num (KB|MB)`. The functionality is still the same.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added replication to community version.
- Added support for multiple query modules directories at the same time. You can
  now define multiple, comma-separated paths to directories from which the
  modules will be loaded using the `--query-modules-directory` flag.
- Added support for programatically reading in data from CSV files through the
  `LOAD CSV` clause. We support CSV files with and without a header, the
  supported dialect being Excel.
- Added a new flag `--memory-limit` which enables the user to set the maximum
  total amount of memory memgraph can allocate during its runtime.
- Added `FREE MEMORY` query which tries to free unusued memory chunks in
  different parts of storage.
- Added the memory limit and amount of currently allocated bytes in the result
  of `SHOW STORAGE INFO` query.
- Added `QUERY MEMORY LIMIT num (KB|MB)` to Cypher queries which allows you to
  limit memory allocation for the entire query. It can be added only at the end
  of the entire Cypher query.
- Added logs for the different parts of the recovery process. `INFO`, `DEBUG`
  and `TRACE` level all contain additional information that is printed out while
  the recovery is in progress.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Fixed garbage collector by correctly marking the oldest current timestamp
  after the database was recovered using the durability files.
- Fixed reloading of the modules with changed result names.
- Fixed profile query to show the correct name of the ScanAll operator variant.

### Lab v1.3.0 - Feb 19, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

### Memgraph v1.3.0 - Jan 26, 2021

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking Changes </h4>}

- Added extra information in durability files to support replication, making it
  incompatible with the durability files generated by older versions of
  Memgraph. Even though the replication is an Enterprise feature, the files are
  compatible with the Community version.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added support for data replication across a cluster of Memgraph instances.
  Supported instance types are MAIN and REPLICA. Supported replication modes are
  SYNC (all SYNC REPLICAS have to receive data before the MAIN can commit the
  transaction), ASYNC (MAIN doesn't care if data is replicated), SYNC WITH
  TIMEOUT (MAIN will wait for REPLICAS within the given timeout period, after
  timout, replication isn't aborted but the replication demotes the REPLICA to
  the ASYNC mode).
- Added support for query type deduction. Possible query types are `r` (read),
  `w` (write), `rw` (read-write). The query type is returned as a part of the
  summary.
- Improved logging capabilities by introducing granular logging levels. Added
  new flag, `--log-level`, which specifies the minimum log level that will be
  printed. E.g., it's possible to print incoming queries or Bolt server states.
- Added ability to lock the storage data directory by executing the `LOCK DATA DIRECTORY` query which delays the deletion of the files contained in the
  data directory. The data directory can be unlocked again by executing the
  `UNLOCK DATA DIRECTORY` query.

### Lab v1.2.0 - Nov 3, 2020

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added ability to create custom graph styling for nodes and edges in graph view
  with graph style language (similar to CSS).
- Added ability to save and load custom graph styling.
- Added ability to show map background for nodes with lat and lng numeric
  properties.
- Added ability to change map background style.
- Removed edge labels to be shown by default in graph view.
- Fixed overall UI and UX.
- Set encrypted connection to be turned off by default on login screen (Memgraph
  v1.2.0 comes with SSL off by default).

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes </h4>}

- Added ability to hide graph view if there are no node/edge data in response.

### Memgraph v1.2.0 - Oct 20, 2020

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Breaking Changes </h4>}

- SSL is disabled by default (`--bolt-cert-file` and `--bolt-key-file are
  empty`). This change might only affect the client connection configuration.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Added support for Bolt v4.0 and v4.1.
- Added `mgp_networkx.py` as an alternative implementation of NetworkX graph
  objects, which is useful to use Memgraph data from NetworkX algorithms
  optimally.
- Added `nxalg.py` query module as a proxy to NetworkX algorithms.
- Added plan optimization to use a label-property index where the property is
  not null. As a result, the query engine, instead of scanning all elements and
  applying the filter, performs a label-property index lookup when possible.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes and Other Changes </h4>}

- Fixed Cypher `ID` function `Null` handling. When the `ID` function receives
  `Null`, it will also return `Null`.
- Fixed bug that caused random crashes in SSL communication on platforms that
  use older versions of OpenSSL (< 1.1) by adding proper multi-threading
  handling.
- Fix `DISCARD` message handling. The query is now executed before discarding
  the results.

### Memgraph v1.1.0 - Jul 1, 2020

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Major Features and Improvements </h4>}

- Properties in nodes and edges are now stored encoded and compressed. This
  change significantly reduces memory usage. Depending on the specific dataset,
  total memory usage can be reduced up to 50%.
- Added support for rescanning query modules. Previously, the query modules
  directory was scanned only upon startup. Now it is scanned each time the user
  requests to load a query module. The functions used to load the query modules
  were renamed to `mg.load()` and `mg.load_all()` (from `mg.reload()` and
  `mg.reload_all()`).
- Improved execution performance of queries that have an IN list filter by using
  label+property indexes. Example: `MATCH (n: Label) WHERE n.property IN [] ...`

- Added support for `ANY` and `NONE` openCypher functions. Previously, only
  `ALL` and `SINGLE` functions were implemented.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Bug Fixes and Other Changes </h4>}

- Fixed invalid paths returned by variable expansion when the starting node and
  destination node used the same symbol. Example: `MATCH path = (n: Person {name: "John"})-[: KNOWS*]->(n) RETURN path`

- Improved semantics of `ALL` and `SINGLE` functions to be consistent with
  openCypher when handling lists with `Null` s.
- `SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO` now returns property names as a list for unique
  constraints.
- Escaped label/property/edgetype names in `DUMP DATABASE` to support names with
  spaces in them.
- Fixed handling of `DUMP DATABASE` queries in multi-command transactions (
  `BEGIN`, ..., `COMMIT`).
- Fixed handling of various query types in explicit transactions. For example,
  constraints were allowed to be created in multi-command transactions (`BEGIN`
  , ..., `COMMIT`) but that isn't a transactional operation and as such can't
  be allowed in multi-command transactions.
- Fixed integer overflow bugs in `COUNT`, `LIMIT` and `SKIP`.
- Fixed integer overflow bugs in weighted shortest path expansions.
- Fixed various other integer overflow bugs in query execution.
- Added Marvel Comic Universe tutorial.
- Added FootballTransfers tutorial.
