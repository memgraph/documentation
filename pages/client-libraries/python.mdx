# Python client guide

Learn how to create a Python application that connects to the Memgraph database and executes simple queries. 

Memgraph currently depends on the [Neo4j Python driver](https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/) for Python. 
Memgraph and Neo4j both support Bolt protocol and Cypher queries, which means that same driver can be used to connect to both databases. 
This is very convenient if switching between the two databases is needed. This guide is based on the driver version v5 and above. Some examples may 
not be supported in older versions of the driver.


## Quickstart

The following guide will demonstrate how to start Memgraph, connect to Memgraph, seed the database with data, and run simple read and write queries. 

Necessary prerequisites that should be installed in your local environment are: 

 - [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) 
 - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

<Steps>

### Run Memgraph 

Start by running Memgraph in the background. The easiest way to install and run Memgraph is by using Docker. Start the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p 3000:3000 --name memgraph -e MEMGRAPH="--bolt-server-name-for-init=Neo4j/"  memgraph/memgraph-platform
```

The command above will start [Memgraph Platform](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker#install-memgraph-platform), which includes [Memgraph database](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker#other-available-docker-images), [Memgraph Lab](/data-visualization#quick-start) and [Memgraph MAGE](/advanced-algorithms#quick-start). Memgraph uses Bolt protocol to communicate with the client using the exposed 7687 port. 
Memgraph Lab is a web application you can use to visualize the data. It's accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if Memgraph Platform is running correctly. The 7444 port enables Memgraph Lab to access and preview the logs, which is why both of these ports need to be exposed. 

For more information visit the getting started guide on [how to run Memgraph with Docker](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker).


### Create a directory 

Next, create a directory for your project and positioning yourself in it:

```bash
mkdir hello-memgraph
cd hello-memgraph
```

### Install Python client library

Before writing any code, you need to install the [Python client library](https://pypi.org/project/neo4j/) which requires Python >= 3.7, and can be installed with `pip`.

```bash
pip install neo4j
```

### Create Python script

Now you can create a new file `main.py` and add the following code snippet: 

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Define correct URI and AUTH arguments (no AUTH by default)
URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("", "")

with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    # Check the connection
    driver.verify_connectivity()

    # Create a user in the database
    records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(
        "CREATE (u:User {name: $name, password: $password}) RETURN u.name AS name;",
        name="John",
        password="pass",
        database_="memgraph",
    )

    # Get the result
    for record in records:
        print(record["name"])

    # Print the query counters
    print(summary.counters)

    # Find a user John in the database
    records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(
        "MATCH (u:User {name: $name}) RETURN u.name AS name",
        name="John",
        database_="memgraph",
    )

    # Get the result
    for record in records:
        print(record["name"])

    # Print the query
    print(summary.query)
```

### Run the application

Now, you can run the application with the following command:

```
python3 main.py
```

If everything was set up correctly, you should see the following output in the terminal: 

```
John
{'labels_added': 1, 'labels_removed': 0, 'nodes_created': 1, 'nodes_deleted': 0, 'properties_set': 0, 'relationships_created': 0, 'relationships_deleted': 0}
John
MATCH (u:User {name: $name}) RETURN u.name AS name
```

### Visualize data

To visualize objects created in the database with the `main.py` script, head over to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and run `MATCH (n) RETURN n;` in the *Query Execution* tab. 
That query will visualize the created node. By clicking on a node, you can explore different properties.

### Next steps 

This makes a good starting point for Python application. For more information on how to use the Python driver, 
continue reading the guide under [Python client API usage and examples](#python-client-api-usage-and-examples). 

</Steps>

## Python client API usage and examples

After a brief [Quickstart guide](#quickstart), this section will go into more detail on how to use the Python driver API, explain code snippets, and provide more examples. Feel free to skip to the section that interests you the most.

### Database connection 

Once the database is running and the driver is installed or available in Python, you should be able to connect to the database in the following ways:

- [Connect without authentication (default)](#connect-without-authentication-default)
- [Connect with authentication](#connect-with-authentication)
- [Connect with self-signed certificate](#encrypted-database-connection-with-self-signed-certificate)


#### Connect without authentication (default)

By default, the Memgraph database is running without authentication, which means that you can connect to the database without providing any credentials (username and password).
To connect to Memgraph, create a driver object with the appropriate URI and credentials arguments. If you're running Memgraph locally, the URI should be similar to `bolt://localhost:7687`, and if you are running Memgraph on a remote server, 
replace `localhost` with the appropriate IP address. 
If you ran Memgraph on a port different than 7687, do not forget to update that in the URI too. 

By default, you can set username and password in the `AUTH("","")` argument as empty strings. This means that you are connecting without authentication.

To connect a Go driver to the Memgraph database without authentication, you can use the following snippet: 
    
```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("", "")

with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    driver.verify_connectivity()

    # Count the number of nodes in the database
    records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(
        "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) AS num_of_nodes;"
    )

    # Get the result
    for record in records:
        print(record["num_of_nodes"])
```

#### Connect with authentication

In order to set up authentication in Memgraph, you need to create a user with a `username` and `password`. In Memgraph you can set a username and password by executing the following query: 

```Cypher
CREATE USER `memgraphUser` IDENTIFIED BY 'memgraphPassword';
```

Then, you can connect to the database with the following snippet:

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("memgraphUser", "memgraphPassword")

with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    driver.verify_connectivity()

    # Count the number of nodes in the database
    records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(
        "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) AS num_of_nodes;", database_="memgraph"
    )

    # Get the result
    for record in records:
        print(record["num_of_nodes"])
```

Notice that the first argument in auth is the username and the second is the password.


#### Connect with self-signed certificate

By adding `bolt+ssc` before the host address in the URI argument, the connection will be encrypted with a self-signed certificate. You will need to use the certificate if you want to **connect to Memgraph Cloud** instance.

When creating a project on Memgraph Cloud, you have a username and you create a password. After the project is started, Memgraph has assigned host address.
Copy those values and paste them in the `<MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS>`, `<MEMGRAPH_USERNAME>` and `<MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD>` fields in the code snippet below to connect successfully to the database.

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

URI = "bolt+ssc://<MEMGRAPH_HOST_ADDRESS>"
AUTH = (<MEMGRAPH_USERNAME>, <MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD>)


with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    driver.verify_connectivity()

    # Count the number of nodes in the database
    records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(
        "CREATE (u:User {name: $name, password: $password}) RETURN u.name AS name",
        name="John",
        password="pass",
        database_="memgraph",
    )

    # Get the result
    for record in records:
        print(record["name"])
```

### Query the database 

After connecting your driver to Memgraph, you can start running queries. The simplest way to run queries is by using the `execute_query()` method which has an automatic transaction management. 

#### Run a create query 

The following query will create a node inside the database: 

```python
node = "CREATE (n:Technology {name:'Memgraph'});"
driver.execute_query(node)
```

Due to the nature of the `execute_query()` method, transactions are handled automatically. 

#### Run a read query 

The following query will read the previously created node from the database: 

```python
node = "MATCH (n:Technology) RETURN n;"
result = driver.execute_query(node)

for record in records:
    node = record["n"] 
    print(node)   

```

In this query, each record contains a node object behind the variable `n`.


#### Running queries with property map

```python
query = "CREATE (n:Technology {id:$id, name: $name, description: $description});"
driver.execute_query(query, 
    id=1, 
    name="MemgraphDB", 
    description="Fastest graph database")
```

Using this approach, the queries will not contain hard-coded values, they can be more dynamic.

### Proces the results 

Processing results from the database is important since we do not want to lose any data during conversions and properly read results and serve them back to the Python application. Python is dynamically typed language, which means that the type of the variable is determined at runtime, which is why we need to be careful when processing results.

#### Process the Node result

In order to process the result you need to read them first, you can do that by running the following query:

```python
query = "MATCH (n:Technology) RETURN n;"
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(query)
```
The `execute_query()` method returns a tuple of three elements: `records`, `summary` and `keys`. The records field contains all the records returned by the query. To process the results, you can iterate over the records and access the fields you need. 

For example: 
    
```python
for record in records:
    node = record["n"]
    print(node)
```
```text
<Node element_id='48' labels=frozenset({'Technology'}) properties={'description': 'Fastest graph database', 'id': 1, 'name': 'MemgraphDB'}>
```

In the example above, each returned record, you can access the `n` field, which is a `Node` returned from a query.

You can access individual properties of the `Node` using one of the following options: 

```python
print(node)             # <Node element_id='47' labels=frozenset({'Technology'}) properties={'description': 'Fastest graph database', 'id': 1, 'name': 'MemgraphDB'}>
print(node.labels)      # frozenset({'Technology'})
print(node.element_id)  # 48
print(node["id"])       # 1
print(node["name"])     # MemgraphDB
```

Keep in mind that the `element_id` property returns the internal ID of the node, which is not the same as the user-defined ID, and it should not 
be used for any application-level logic.

#### Process the Relationship result

You can also receive a relationship from a query. For example: 

```python
    query = "CREATE (u:User {name: 'John'})-[r:LOVES {id:99}]->(t:Technology {name: 'Memgraph'})"
    driver.execute_query(query)

    query = "MATCH (u:User)-[r:LOVES]->(t:Technology) RETURN r"
    records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(query)
    for record in records:
        relationship = record["r"]
        print(relationship)
        print(relationship.element_id)
        print(relationship["id"])
        print(relationship.type)
        print(relationship.nodes)

```
You can access the `Relationship` properties just like the [Node](#process-the-node-result) properties. Keep in mind that `element_id` is the internal ID of the relationship, which is not the same as the user-defined ID, and it should not be used for any application-level logic.

#### Process the Path result

You can receive path from the database, using the following construct:

```python
query = "MATCH p=(d:User)-[r:LOVES]->(t:Technology) RETURN p"
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(query)
for record in records:
    path = record["p"]
    print(path)
    print(path.nodes)
    print(path.relationships)  
    print(path.start_node)
    print(path.end_node)
```

Path will contain [Nodes](#process-the-node-result) and [Relationships[#process-the-relationship-result], that can be accessed in the same way as in the previous examples.

### Transaction management

Transaction is a unit of work that is executed on the database, it could be some basic read, write or complex set of steps in form of series of queries. There can be multiple ways to mange transaction, but usually, they are managed automatically by the driver or manually by the explicit code steps. Transaction management defines how to handle the transaction, when to commit, rollback, or terminate it.

#### Automatic transaction management 

To query the database, run the `execute_query()` procedure on the driver object with the Cypher query argument, its parameters and the database name.
A good practice is to provide a database name as it avoids unnecessary requests to the server and, in that way, improves performance.  It's also recommended to provide parameters to protect your queries from Cypher injections.
In v2.10, Memgraph added the [multi-tenant support](/configuration/multi-tenancy) to the Enterprise Edition to manage multiple isolated databases within a single instance. If you're working with more than one tenant, be sure to provide the correct database name.

The `execute_query()` procedure automatically creates a transaction that can include multiple Cypher statements as a single query. If the transaction fails, the procedure will automatically rerun it.

Bolt protocol specifies additional [metadata](/configuration/metadata) that can be sent along with the requested results. Metadata can be divided into two groups: query statistics and notifications.
The query statistics metadata provides query counters that indicate the changes that the **write query** triggered on the server.

```python
with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    # Create a user in the database
    records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(
        "CREATE (u:User {name: $name, password: $password}) RETURN u.name AS name",
        name="John",
        password="pass",
        database_="memgraph",
    )

    # Get the result
    for record in records:
        print(record["name"])

    # Print the query counters
    print(summary.counters)
```

**Read queries** can be run in the same way, but they will not return any query counters because the read queries are not making any changes on the server.
The summary will provide other information, such as the query that was run.

```python
with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    # Find a user John in the database
    records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query(
        "MATCH (u:User {name: $name}) RETURN u.name AS name",
        name="John",
        database_="memgraph",
    )

    # Get the result
    for record in records:
        print(record["name"])

    # Print the query
    print(summary.query)
```

On **update** and **delete queries** it is again useful to get the query counters to be sure how your change affected the database.

<Callout type="warning">

Error with multicommand transactions

If you experience the `Index manipulation not allowed in multicommand transactions` error,  use [implicit (or auto-commit) transactions](#implicit-transactions).
Implicit transactions are the simplest way to run Cypher queries because they aren't automatically rerun as they are in the `execute_query()` procedure or when using managed transactions.
To create a label-property index on `:User(name)`, run the following code:

```python
with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH).session(database="memgraph") as session:
    session.run("CREATE INDEX ON :User(name);")
```

</Callout>

#### Manual transaction

When using the `execute_query()` procedure, you don't have complete control over the transaction lifecycle because it creates a transaction that can only be committed or rolled back on failure.
If you want more control over the query execution, use managed transactions to run the queries.

To run a managed transaction, you first need to create a **session**:

```python
my_session = driver.session(database="memgraph")
# do something with the session
my_session.close()
```

Don't forget to close the session after usage with `session.close()` or Python `with` statement, which will automatically close a session, like in the following code snippet:

```python
with driver.session(database="memgraph") as session:
    # do something with the session

# session is automatically closed
```

Sessions are not thread safe, so make sure that each thread creates its own sessions. On the other hand, the main driver object can be shared across threads.
One transaction can contain multiple queries and they will either all be executed or none of them. This means that you don't have to worry about rolling back the part of the changes that got executed in that transaction and finding the ones that didn't.
Having more than one query in a transaction is useful when those queries work on a similar database task, usually creating graph database objects.

With sessions, you can run:

- [Manged transactions](#managed-transactions) - to run multiple queries with automatic retries without the possibility to roll back a query within a transaction.
- [Explicit transactions](#explicit-transactions) - to get full control over transactions by explicitely controlling the end of transaction that won't be automatically retried.
- [Implicit transactions](#implicit-transactions) - the simplest way to run a Cypher query that won't be automatically retried.

##### Managed transactions

To create a managed transaction, use `Session.execute_read()` procedure for read queries and `Session.execute_write()` procedure for write queries.

```python
def match_user(tx, name):
    result = tx.run(
        """
        MATCH (u:User) WHERE startsWith(u.name, $user_name)
        RETURN u.name as name
        """,
        user_name=name,
    )
    # process the result
    return list(result)


with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    with driver.session(database="memgraph") as session:
        people = session.execute_read(
            # transaction function callback
            match_user,
            "John",
        )
        for person in people:
            # get the result record as dict (key: value)
            print(person.data())
```

In case of exception being raised, the **transaction will be automatically rolled back**. If there is a return statement within transaction function, the transaction will be comitted.
In some cases, if a transaction fails, it is **automatically** being **retried**. That means that you can't be sure how many times a transaction function will be executed so you have to be careful that it produces the same effect when run multiple times.
Regardless of that, the queries inside the transaction function will always run only once. Session can contain multiple transactions but ony one transaction is active at any given time within session.
To maintain multiple concurrent transactions, use [multiple concurrent sessions](#concurrent-transactions).

##### Explicit transactions

With explicit transactions you can get the **full control over transactions**. To begin a transaction, run `Session.begin_transaction()` procedure and to run a transaction use `Transaction.run()` procedure.
Explicit transaction offers the possibility of explicitely controlling the end of transaction with `Transaction.commit()`, `Transaction.rollback()` or `Transaction.close()` methods, depending on what you need.

Use explicit transaction if you need to **distribute Cypher execution across multiple functions for the same transaction** or if you need to **run multiple queries within a single transactions without automatic retries**.

Here is an example of how to explicitly control the transaction of changing account balances based on some token transfer:

```python
def create_users(driver, sender, receiver):
    # Run multiple statements in a single query with execute_query() - not an explicit transaction
    # If there is a failure, it will be rolled back
    summary = driver.execute_query(
        """
            CREATE (:User {id: $sender_id, name: $sender_name, account_balance: $sender_account_balance})
            CREATE (:User {id: $receiver_id, name: $receiver_name, account_balance: $receiver_account_balance})
        """,
        sender_id=sender["id"],
        sender_name=sender["name"],
        sender_account_balance=sender["account_balance"],
        receiver_id=receiver["id"],
        receiver_name=receiver["name"],
        receiver_account_balance=receiver["account_balance"],
    ).summary

    print(
        "Created {nodes_created} nodes.".format(
            nodes_created=summary.counters.nodes_created
        )
    )


def transfer_tokens(driver, sender_id, receiver_id, num_of_tokens):
    with driver.session(database="memgraph") as session:
        tx = session.begin_transaction()

        try:
            if not is_enough_token(tx, sender_id, num_of_tokens):
                print("Not enough tokens in the account balance.")
                return
            try:
                decrease_sender_balance(tx, sender_id, num_of_tokens)
                increase_receiver_balance(tx, receiver_id, num_of_tokens)
                tx.commit()  # both should be committed or none
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # if exception happened roll back both
        finally:
            tx.close()  # rolls back if not yet committed


def is_enough_token(tx, user_id, num_of_tokens):
    query = """
        MATCH (u:User {id: $id})
        RETURN u.account_balance - $num_of_tokens >= 0 AS is_enough
    """
    result = tx.run(query, id=user_id, num_of_tokens=num_of_tokens)
    record = result.single(strict=True)
    return record["is_enough"]


def decrease_sender_balance(tx, sender_id, num_of_tokens):
    query = """
        MATCH (u:User {id: $id})
        SET u.account_balance = u.account_balance - $num_of_tokens
    """
    result = tx.run(query, id=sender_id, num_of_tokens=num_of_tokens)
    result.consume()


def increase_receiver_balance(tx, receiver_id, num_of_tokens):
    query = """
        MATCH (u:User {id: $id})
        SET u.account_balance = u.account_balance + $num_of_tokens
    """
    result = tx.run(query, id=receiver_id, num_of_tokens=num_of_tokens)
    result.consume()


def main():
    # If John has < 10 on his account balance, he won't have enough to send 10 tokens to Jenna
    sender = {"id": 1, "account_balance": 1000, "name": "John"}
    receiver = {"id": 2, "account_balance": 2000, "name": "Jenna"}

    with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
        create_users(driver, sender, receiver)
        transfer_tokens(driver, 1, 2, 10)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the above example, if you change John's account balance to a number less than 10, you will see the warning that he doesn't have enough tokens and the transfer won't happen (it will be rolled back).

##### Implicit transactions

Implicit or auto-commit transactions are the simplest way to run a Cypher query since they won't be automatically retried as with `execute_query()` procedure or managed transactions.
With implicit transactions, you don't have the same control of transaction as with explicit transactions, so they are mostly used for quick prototyping.

To run an implicit transaction, use `Session.run()` method:

```python
with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    with driver.session(database="memgraph") as session:
        session.run("CREATE (u:User {name: $name})", name="John")
```

The `Session.run()` method is most commonly used for `LOAD CSV` clause to prevent timeout errors due to the size of the transaction.

#### Concurrent transactions

It is possible to run concurrent transactions with Python's `asyncio` library through `AsyncGraphDatabase` driver.
The code is not that different from the synchronous version, except that you must use await on all async calls, and define as async all functions that should be awaited.

Here is how you can use the driver with the `execute_query()` method:

```python
import asyncio
from neo4j import AsyncGraphDatabase


URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("", "")


async def main():
    async with AsyncGraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
        records, summary, keys = await driver.execute_query(
            "MATCH (u:User) RETURN u.name AS name", database_="memgraph"
        )
        names = [record["name"] for record in records]
        print(names)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Here is how you can use the driver with transaction functions:

```python
import asyncio
from neo4j import AsyncGraphDatabase


URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("", "")


async def main():
    async with AsyncGraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
        async with driver.session(database="memgraph") as session:
            records = await session.execute_read(get_users)
            print(records)


async def get_users(tx):
    result = await tx.run("MATCH (u:User) RETURN u.name AS name")
    records = await result.values()
    return records


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
