# Go quick start guide 

Learn how to create a Go application that connects to the Memgraph database, execute simple queries, and runs a query module.
This will introduce you to the basics of Memgraph and the Go driver 

<Callout type="info"> 

Go driver

You can find the official Go driver on
[GitHub](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver).

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you will need:

- The newest version of **Go** [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).
- A **running Memgraph instance**. If you need to set up Memgraph, take a look
  at the [Installation guide](/getting-started/install-memgraph).
- A basic understanding of graph databases and the property graph model.


## Project setup

Start by creating a new project directory and positioning yourself in it:

```bash
mkdir hello-memgraph
cd hello-memgraph
```

Next, initialize a new Go module:

```bash
go mod init hello-memgraph
```

You just used a go tool to create a new module file go.mod that takes care of your dependencies, if you are not familiar with it take a look at 
the guide on [how to write a Go code](https://go.dev/doc/code). 

Now you can create a new file `main.go` and add the following code snippet. 

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j"
)

func main() {

    dbUri := "bolt://localhost:7687" // (Default Memgraph Bolt port is 7687)
	driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.BasicAuth("", "", ""))

	ctx := context.Background()
	defer driver.Close(ctx)

	err = driver.VerifyConnectivity(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Viola! Connected to Memgraph!")
	}

}

```

After that run the following command to install all the dependencies you have in your import section. 

```bash
go mod tidy
```

Now you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
go run ./main.go
```
