# GO client guide 

Learn how to create a Go application that connects to the Memgraph database and executes simple queries. 

Memgraph currently depends on the [Neo4j Golang driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j#pkg-types). 
Memgraph and Neo4j both support Bolt protocol and Cypher queries, which means that same driver can be used to connect to both databases. 
This is very convenient if switching between the two databases is needed. This guide is based on the driver version v5 and above. Some examples may 
not be supported in older versions of the driver.

## Quickstart 

The following guide will demonstrate how to start Memgraph, connect to Memgraph, seed the database with data, and run simple read and write queries. 

Necessary prerequisites that should be installed in your local environment are: 

 - [Go programming language](https://go.dev/dl/) 
 - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

<Steps>

### Run Memgraph 

If you're new to Memgraph or you're in a developing stage, we
recommend using the Memgraph Platform. Besides the database, it also
includes all the tools you might need to analyze your data, such as command-line
interface [mgconsole](/getting-started/cli), web interface [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization) and a complete set of algorithms within a
[MAGE](/advanced-algorithms) library.

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is running in the
background. Depending on your operating system, execute the appropriate command
in the console:

**For Linux and macOS:**

<CodeSnippet code="curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh" page="client-libraries/go" os="linux/macOS"/>

**For Windows:**

<CodeSnippet code="iwr https://windows.memgraph.com | iex" page="client-libraries/go" os="windows"/>

The command above will start [Memgraph
Platform](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker#install-memgraph-platform),
which includes [Memgraph
database](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker#other-available-docker-images),
[Memgraph Lab](/data-visualization#quick-start) and [Memgraph
MAGE](/advanced-algorithms#quick-start). Memgraph uses Bolt protocol to
communicate with the client using the exposed 7687 port. Memgraph Lab is a web
application you can use to visualize the data. It's accessible at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if Memgraph Platform is running
correctly. The 7444 port enables Memgraph Lab to access and preview the logs,
which is why both of these ports need to be exposed. 

For more information visit the getting started guide on [how to run Memgraph
with Docker](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker).

### Create a directory 

Next, create a directory for your project and positioning yourself in it:

```bash
mkdir hello-memgraph
cd hello-memgraph
```

### Initialize Go module 

Now, initialize a new Go module using the following command:

```bash
go mod init hello-memgraph
```

The command above uses a Go tool to create a new module file `go.mod` that takes care of dependencies in Go projects, if you are not familiar with it take a look at 
the basic guide on [how to write a Go code](https://go.dev/doc/code). 

### Write a minimal working example 

Now you can create a new file `main.go` and add the following code snippet: 

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j"
)

func main() {

	dbUser := ""
	dbPassword := ""
	dbUri := "bolt://localhost:7687" // scheme://host(:port) (default port is 7687)
	driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.BasicAuth(dbUser, dbPassword, ""))
	ctx := context.Background()
	defer driver.Close(ctx)

	err = driver.VerifyConnectivity(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Viola! Connected to Memgraph!")
	}

	//Create indexes on developer and technology nodes
	indexes := []string{
		"CREATE INDEX ON :Developer(id);",
		"CREATE INDEX ON :Technology(id);",
		"CREATE INDEX ON :Developer(name);",
		"CREATE INDEX ON :Technology(name);",
	}

	//Create developer nodes
	developer_nodes := []string{
		"CREATE (n:Developer {id: 1, name:'Andy'});",
		"CREATE (n:Developer {id: 2, name:'John'});",
		"CREATE (n:Developer {id: 3, name:'Michael'});",
	}

	//Create technology nodes
	technology_nodes := []string{
		"CREATE (n:Technology {id: 1, name:'Memgraph', description: 'Fastest graph DB in the world!', createdAt: Date()})",
		"CREATE (n:Technology {id: 2, name:'Go', description: 'Go programming language ', createdAt: Date()})",
		"CREATE (n:Technology {id: 3, name:'Docker', description: 'Docker containerization engine', createdAt: Date()})",
		"CREATE (n:Technology {id: 4, name:'Kubernetes', description: 'Kubernetes container orchestration engine', createdAt: Date()})",
		"CREATE (n:Technology {id: 5, name:'Python', description: 'Python programming language', createdAt: Date()})",
	}

	//Create relationships between developers and technologies
	relationships := []string{
		"MATCH (a:Developer {id: 1}),(b:Technology {id: 1}) CREATE (a)-[r:LOVES]->(b);",
		"MATCH (a:Developer {id: 2}),(b:Technology {id: 3}) CREATE (a)-[r:LOVES]->(b);",
		"MATCH (a:Developer {id: 3}),(b:Technology {id: 1}) CREATE (a)-[r:LOVES]->(b);",
		"MATCH (a:Developer {id: 1}),(b:Technology {id: 5}) CREATE (a)-[r:LOVES]->(b);",
		"MATCH (a:Developer {id: 2}),(b:Technology {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[r:LOVES]->(b);",
		"MATCH (a:Developer {id: 3}),(b:Technology {id: 4}) CREATE (a)-[r:LOVES]->(b);",
	}

	//Create a simple session
	session := driver.NewSession(ctx, neo4j.SessionConfig{DatabaseName: ""})
	defer session.Close(ctx)

	// Run index queries via implicit auto-commit transaction
	for _, index := range indexes {
		_, err = session.Run(ctx, index, nil)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("****** Indexes created *******")

	// Run developer node queries
	for _, node := range developer_nodes {
		_, err = neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, node, nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase(""))
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("****** Developer nodes created *******")

	// Run technology node queries
	for _, node := range technology_nodes {
		_, err = neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, node, nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase(""))
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("****** Technology nodes created *******")

	// Run relationship queries
	for _, rel := range relationships {
		_, err = neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, rel, nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase(""))
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("****** Relationships created *******")

	// Read a node
	query := "MATCH (n:Technology{name: 'Memgraph'}) RETURN n;"
	result, err := neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, query, nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase(""))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	
	// Print the node results
	for _, node := range result.Records {
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node))												// Node type
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).GetProperties())								// Node properties
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).GetElementId())								// Node internal ID
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Labels)										// Node labels
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Props["id"].(int64))							// Node user defined id property 
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Props["name"].(string))						// Node user defined name property
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Props["description"].(string))				// Node user defined description property
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Props["createdAt"].(neo4j.Date).Time())		// Node user defined createdAt property

	}
	fmt.Println("****** End *******")
```

This code snippet is a minimal working example that will create a connection to the Memgraph database via Go driver, create indexes, create nodes and relationships, and read the data back. Take a look at the code in detail as
it includes comments to help you understand it. The [Go client API usage and examples](#go-client-api-usage-and-examples) section will explain the code snippet in more details.

### Install dependencies

Once you've created the file, run the following command to install all the Go dependencies present in the Go modules section. 

```bash
go mod tidy
```
At this point, there should be only one dependency left to install, the Neo4j Go driver. 

### Project hierarchy

The project hierarchy should look like this: 

```text
hello-memgraph
├── go.mod
├── main.go
├── go.sum

```
Don't modify the `go.sum` file as it is used by the Go tool to keep track of the dependencies checksums, and to verify that the dependencies have not changed.

### Run the application

Now, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
go run ./main.go
```

If everything was set up correctly, you should see the following output in the terminal: 

```text
Viola! Connected to Memgraph!
****** Indexes created *******
****** Developer nodes created *******
****** Technology nodes created *******
****** Relationships created *******
****** Node values: *******
{52 52 [Technology] map[createdAt:{0 63828777600 <nil>} description:Fastest graph DB in the world! id:1 name:Memgraph]}
map[createdAt:{0 63828777600 <nil>} description:Fastest graph DB in the world! id:1 name:Memgraph]
52
[Technology]
1
Memgraph
Fastest graph DB in the world!
2023-08-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
****** End *******
```

### Visualize the data 

To visualize objects created in the database with the `main.go` script, head over to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and run `MATCH path=(n)-[p]-(m) RETURN path` in the *Query Execution* tab. 
That query will visualize the created nodes and relationships. By clicking on a node or relationship, you can explore different properties.

### Next steps 

This makes a good starting point for Go application. For more information on how to use the Go driver, 
continue reading the guide under [Go client API usage and examples](#go-client-api-usage-and-examples). 

</Steps>

## Go client API usage and examples 

After a brief [Quickstart guide](#quickstart), this section will go into more detail on how to use the Go driver API, explain code snippets, and provide more examples. Feel free to skip to the section that interests you the most.

### Database connection 

Once the database is running and the driver is installed or available in GO, you should be able to connect to the database in one of two ways:

- [Connect without authentication (default)](#connect-without-authentication-default)
- [Connect with authentication](#connect-with-authentication)

#### Connect without authentication (default)

By default, the Memgraph database is running without authentication, which means that you can connect to the database without providing any credentials (username and password).
To connect to Memgraph, create a driver object with the appropriate URI and credentials arguments. If you're running Memgraph locally, the URI should be similar to `bolt://localhost:7687`, and if you are running Memgraph on a remote server, 
replace `localhost` with the appropriate IP address. 
If you ran Memgraph on a port different than 7687, do not forget to update that in the URI too. 

By default, you can set username and password in the `neo4j.BasicAuth("","","")` argument as empty strings. This means that you are connecting without authentication.

To connect a Go driver to the Memgraph database without authentication, you can use the following snippet: 

```go {12-13}
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j"
)

func main() {

    dbUri := "bolt://localhost:7687" // (Default Memgraph Bolt port is 7687)
	driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.BasicAuth("", "", ""))

	ctx := context.Background()
	defer driver.Close(ctx)

	err = driver.VerifyConnectivity(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Viola! Connected to Memgraph!")
	}

}

``` 

Notice that BasicAuth takes three arguments, the first two are `username` and `password`, and the third one is the `realm`.   Realm is an optional argument that can be used to specify the authentication realm. If no realm is specified, an empty string can be used.
For both `username` and `password`, the empty string is passed, which means that you are connecting without authentication.

#### Connect with authentication

In order to set up authentication in Memgraph, you need to create a user with a `username` and `password`. In Memgraph you can set a username and password by executing the following query: 

```Cypher
CREATE USER `memgraph` IDENTIFIED BY 'memgraph';
```

Then, you can connect to the database with the following snippet:

```go {12-15}
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j"
)

func main() {

	dbUser := "memgraph"
	dbPassword := "memgraph"
	dbUri := "bolt://localhost:7687" // (Default Memgraph Bolt port is 7687)
	driver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.BasicAuth(dbUser, dbPassword, ""))

	ctx := context.Background()
	defer driver.Close(ctx)

	err = driver.VerifyConnectivity(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Viola! Connected to Memgraph!")
	}

}

``` 

You may receive this error: 

```panic: Neo4jError: Memgraph.ClientError.Security.Unauthenticated (Authentication failure)```
    
The error indicates that you have probably enabled authentication in Memgraph, but are trying to connect without authentication. For more details on how to set authentication further, visit the [Memgraph authentication guide](/configuration/security/#creating-user).

#### Go client connection lifecycle management 

Once the driver connection to Memgraph is established, it doesn't need to be closed. It's sufficient to open a single client connection to Memgraph and use it for all queries.
In the examples above, Go [context](https://pkg.go.dev/context) has been used to manage the client's lifecycle. In this case, the client's lifetime is tied to the application's lifecycle.

The following code snippet will make sure to close the client connection once the application is finished: 

```go
ctx := context.Background()
defer driver.Close(ctx)
```

Keep in mind that driver object is thread safe, and can be reused between different threads. 

### Query the database 

After connecting your driver to Memgraph, you can start running queries. The simplest way to run queries is by using the `ExecuteQuery()` method which has an automatic transaction management. 

#### Run a create query 

The following query will create a node inside the database: 

```go 
node := "CREATE (n:Technology {name:'Memgraph'});"
_, err = neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, node, nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase("memgraph"))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

The `ExecuteQuery()` method takes the following arguments:

- `ctx` - context of the application.
- `driver` - driver object connected to the Memgraph database.
- `query` - Cypher query that need to be executed.
- `params` - parameters passed to the query.
- `resultTransformer` - the result transformer that will transform the result into the desired format.
- `config` - query configuration, like database name, user, etc.

Due to the nature of the `ExecuteQuery()` method, transactions are handled automatically. 

#### Run a read query 

The following query will read data from the database: 

```go
result, err := neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, "MATCH (n:Technology{name: 'Memgraph'}) RETURN n", nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase("memgraph"))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
} else {
	fmt.Println(result)
}

// Print each node as map
for _, node := range result.Records {
	fmt.Println(node.AsMap())
}
```
In this query, each record contains a node accessible by the `AsMap()` method.

#### Running queries with property map

If you want to pass a property map to the query, you can do it in the following way

```go
_, err = neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, "CREATE (n:Technology{name: $name, type: $type})", map[string]any{"name": "Memgraph", "type": "graph database"}, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase(""))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```
Using this approach, the queries will not contain hard-coded values, they can be more dynamic.

### Process the results

Processing results from the database is important since we do not want to lose any data during conversions. To properly read results and serve them back to the Go application, they need to be cast into proper types. 

Depending on the type of request made, you can receive different results, `Nodes`, `Relationships`, `Paths` etc. Let's go over a few basic examples of how to handle different types and access properties of the returned results.

#### Process the Node result

In order to process the result you need to read them first, you can do that by running the following query:
```go
result, err := neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, "MATCH (n:Technology{name: 'Memgraph'}) RETURN n", nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase("memgraph"))
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```
The `ExceuteQuery` method returns results in the `EagerResults` format, giving you access to the `Records` field. The records field contains all the records returned by the query. To process the results, you can iterate over the records and access the fields you need. 

For example: 

```go
for _, node := range result.Records {
    fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node))
}
```
```text
{65 65 [Technology] map[createdAt:{0 63828259200 <nil>} description:Fastest graph DB in the world! id:1 name:Memgraph]}
```
In the example above, each returned record is converted into a map. From the map, you can access the `n` field, which is a `Node` returned from a query. The returned record and all its properties are of type `any`. This means you have to cast them to the relevant Go type if you want to use methods or features defined on such types. 

You can access individual properties of the `Node` using one of the following options: 

```go
node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).GetProperties() // map[createdAt:{0 63828259200 <nil>} description:Fastest graph DB in the world! id:1 name:Memgraph]
node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).GetElementId() // 65
node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Labels // [Technology]
node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Props["id"].(int64) // 1
node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Props["name"].(string) // Memgraph
node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Props["description"].(string) // Fastest graph DB in the world!
node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node).Props["createdAt"].(neo4j.Date).Time() // 2023-08-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC

```

You can access all `Node` properties by casting and accessing the `Props` field. Keep in mind that the `GetElementId()` method returns the internal ID of the node, which is not the same as the user-defined ID, and it should not 
be used for any application-level logic.


#### Process the Relationship result

You can also receive a relationship from a query. For example: 

```go {14-22}
//Create a relationship between two nodes, developer and technology
query = "CREATE (d:Developer {name: 'John Doe'})-[:USES {id:99}]->(t:Technology {id: 1, name:'Memgraph', description: 'Fastest graph DB in the world!', createdAt: Date()});"
_, err = neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, query, nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase(""))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

//Read a relationship between two nodes, developer and technology
query = "MATCH (d:Developer)-[r:USES]->(t:Technology) RETURN r"
result, err = neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, query, nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase(""))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
// Process results 
for _, rel := range result.Records {
	fmt.Println(rel.AsMap()["r"].(neo4j.Relationship))
	fmt.Println(rel.AsMap()["r"].(neo4j.Relationship).GetProperties())
	fmt.Println(rel.AsMap()["r"].(neo4j.Relationship).GetElementId())
	fmt.Println(rel.AsMap()["r"].(neo4j.Relationship).Type)
	fmt.Println(rel.AsMap()["r"].(neo4j.Relationship).StartElementId)
	fmt.Println(rel.AsMap()["r"].(neo4j.Relationship).EndElementId)
	fmt.Println(rel.AsMap()["r"].(neo4j.Relationship).Props["id"].(int64))
}
```
You can access the `Relationship` properties just like the [Node](#process-the-node-result) properties. `StartElementId` and `EndElementId` are the internal IDs of the start and end nodes of the relationship.

#### Process the Path result

You can receive path from the database, using the following construct:

```go
query = "MATCH p=(d:Developer)-[r:USES]->(t:Technology) RETURN p"
result, err = neo4j.ExecuteQuery(ctx, driver, query, nil, neo4j.EagerResultTransformer, neo4j.ExecuteQueryWithDatabase(""))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

for _, path := range result.Records {
	fmt.Println(path.AsMap()["p"].(neo4j.Path))
	fmt.Println(path.AsMap()["p"].(neo4j.Path).Nodes)
	fmt.Println(path.AsMap()["p"].(neo4j.Path).Relationships)
}
```

Path will contain [Nodes](#process-the-node-result) and [Relationships](#process-the-relationship-result), that can be accessed in the same way as in the previous examples, by casting them to the relevant type.

#### Types mapping and casting

 Here is the full table of the mapping between Memgraph Cypher types and the types used in the Go driver:

|  Cypher Type | Driver Type        |
|-------------:|:-------------------|
|          Null| nil                |
|       String | string             |
|      Boolean | bool               |
|      Integer | int64              |
|        Float | float              |
|         List | []any              |
|          Map | map[string]any     |
|         Node | neo4j.Node         |
| Relationship | neo4j.Relationship |
|         Path | neo4j.Path         |
|     Duration | neo4j.Duration     |
|         Date | neo4j.Date         |
|    LocalTime | neo4j.LocalTime    |
|LocalDateTime | neo4j.LocalDateTime|

Keep in mind that Memgraph does not support timezones at the moment. 

### Transaction management

Transaction is a unit of work that is executed on the database, it could be some basic read, write or complex set of steps in form of series of queries. There can be multiple ways to mange transaction, but usually, they are managed automatically by the driver or manually by the explicit code steps. Transaction management defines how to handle the transaction, when to commit, rollback, or terminate it.

On the driver side, if a transaction fails because of a transient error, the transaction is retried automatically. 
The transient error will occur during write conflicts or network failures. The driver will retry the transaction function with an exponentially increasing delay.

#### Automatic transaction management 

Using the `ExecuteQuery()` method, the driver takes care of the transaction for the Cypher query you are trying to execute. The `ExceuteQuery()` method should be used when transaction control is unnecessary. Multiple queries can be passed inside the `ExecuteQuery()` method.

<Callout type="warning">

Error with multicommand transactions

***Index manipulation not allowed in multicommand transactions*** is a kind of error you might experience. To fix that, use [implicit (or auto-commit) transactions](#implicit-transactions) instead.

</Callout>

The automatic transaction management has been used in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section, so you can take a look at the code samples there to see how it works.

#### Manual transaction management

Manaual transaction management provieds more control and fexibility to the code running transaction, which can help with optimisation and correctness. It is based on chunking multiple queries, rolling back, terminating, and committing transactions based on bussines logic and requirements.
This usually comes with a cost of more code and more complexity.

##### Session management

Before you manage manual transactions, you'll need to create a session. A session is a specific connection to the database that can live for a certain period. The session connection is lightweight and should be closed after the 
wanted queries have been executed. You don't need to keep the session open for the whole duration of the application. To open a session, use the code snippet below: 

```go
session := driver.NewSession(ctx, neo4j.SessionConfig{DatabaseName: "neo4j"})
defer session.Close(ctx)
```

Sessions are not thread safe, so you should create a new session for each Go routine. 

With sessions, you can:

- [Managed transactions](#managed-transactions) - run multiple queries with automatic retries without the possibility to roll back a query within a transaction.
- [Explicit transactions](#explicit-transactions) - get full control over transactions by explicitly controlling the end of transaction that won't be automatically retried.
- [Implicit transactions](#implicit-transactions) - run a Cypher query that won't be automatically retried.


[Session](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j#SessionWithContext) have multiple access points that can be used to access the database: 

- `ExecuteRead` - executes a defined transaction workload in read access mode with retry logic. (managed transaction)
- `ExecuteWrite` - executes a defined transaction workload in write access mode with retry logic. (managed transaction)
- `BeginTransaction` - starts a new explicit transaction. (explicit transaction)
- `Run` - executes a auto-commit statement and returns result. (implicit transaction)

##### Managed Transactions

In some cases, when using automatic transactions via `ExecuteQuery()`, you cannot have business logic between transactions. For that reason, manually managing transactions is also possible, which can bring flexibility to how the queries are executed. 
If you want to read data from the database, here is an example of a managed transaction:
```go {1-14}
	nodes, err := session.ExecuteRead(ctx,
		func(tx neo4j.ManagedTransaction) (any, error) {
			result, err := tx.Run(ctx, `  
				MATCH (n:Technology) WHERE n.name = "Memgraph"
				RETURN n;
				`, map[string]any{
				"filter": "Memgraph",
			})
			records, err := result.Collect(ctx)
			if err != nil {
				return nil, err
			}
			return records, nil
		})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	} else {
		for _, tech := range nodes.([]*neo4j.Record) {
			fmt.Println(tech.AsMap())
		}
	}
```

In the example above the `session.ExecuteRead` gets the function as an argument, the function is executed as a single transaction unit, and the result are returned from the function to the `session.ExecuteRead` method call. 

Additional custom processing can be done on the result, such as running a second query inside the same transaction to return the wanted results. 
For example: 

```go {12-30}
nodes, err := session.ExecuteRead(ctx,
		func(tx neo4j.ManagedTransaction) (any, error) {
			result, err := tx.Run(ctx, `  
				MATCH (n:Technology) WHERE n.name = $filter
				RETURN n;
				`, map[string]any{
				"filter": "Memgraph",
			})
			if err != nil {
				return nil, err
			}
			records, _ := result.Collect(ctx)

			second_results, err := tx.Run(ctx, `
				MATCH (n:Technology) WHERE n.name = $filter
				RETURN n;
				`, map[string]any{
				"filter": "Go",
			})
			if err != nil {
				return nil, err
			}
			second_records, _ := second_results.Collect(ctx)

			records = append(records, second_records...)

			// Do some custom processing here

			return records, nil
		})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	} else {
		for _, tech := range nodes.([]*neo4j.Record) {
			fmt.Println(tech.AsMap())
		}
	}
```

The highlighted code contains two queries inside the same transaction, and the results of the second query are appended to the results of the first one. Chaining different queries in this manner gives you the flexibility to run custom processing on the results.

##### Explicit Transactions

In some scenarios, managed transactions cannot be `rolled back` or `committed`. In that case, explicit transactions must be used. Explicit transactions are the most flexible way to run Cypher queries, as they provide full control over transactions and explicit control of the transaction's end.

For example: 

```go
tx, err := session.BeginTransaction(ctx)
tx.Run(ctx, "CREATE (n:Technology {name:'Memgraph'});", nil)
tx.Commit(ctx) // or tx.Rollback(ctx)
```


Here is the full working example based on the explicit transaction: 

```go {52, 53}

func getTechNodesByName(ctx context.Context, tx neo4j.ExplicitTransaction, name string) (any, error) {
	result, err := tx.Run(ctx, `
		MATCH (n:Technology) WHERE n.name = $filter
		RETURN n;
		`, map[string]any{
		"filter": name,
	})
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	records, _ := result.Collect(ctx)
	return records, nil
}

func getDevNodesByName(ctx context.Context, tx neo4j.ExplicitTransaction, name string) (any, error) {
	result, err := tx.Run(ctx, `
		MATCH (n:Developer) WHERE n.name = $filter
		RETURN n;
		`, map[string]any{
		"filter": name,
	})
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	records, _ := result.Collect(ctx)
	return records, nil
}

	// Rest of the main missing for brevity

	tx, err := session.BeginTransaction(ctx)

	memgraph, err := getTechNodesByName(ctx, tx, "Memgraph")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	for _, node := range memgraph.([]*neo4j.Record) {
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node))
	}

	goLang, err := getTechNodesByName(ctx, tx, "Go")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	for _, node := range goLang.([]*neo4j.Record) {
		fmt.Println(node.AsMap()["n"].(neo4j.Node))
	}

	//custom processing 

	err = tx.Commit(ctx) 
	// or tx.Rollback(ctx)
	if err != nil {

		fmt.Println("Error committing transaction")
		fmt.Println("Transaction rolled back because of error" + err.Error())
	}
	// Rest of the main missing for brevity

```

##### Implicit transaction 

Implicit or auto-commit transactions won't be automatically retried as with `ExecuteQuery()` method or managed transactions.
With implicit transactions, you don't have the same control over transactions as with managed transactions. This is the most primitive way of running transactions: 


```go
	session := driver.NewSession(ctx, neo4j.SessionConfig{DatabaseName: "memgraph"})
	defer session.Close(ctx)

	session.Run(ctx, "CREATE INDEX ON :Developer(id);", nil)

```
 
The code above does not retry or have special checks, it just runs the query and returns the result, if there is any.
