# Manage Memgraph in Linux native environment

Learn the best practices for managing your Memgraph instance in the native Linux
environment. This guide will cover the most common tasks you might need to do
while configuring and running Memgraph in the Linux native environment. 

Keep in mind that links from this guide will take you to the other documentation
pages that cover the specific topic in more detail.

## Install Memgraph on Linux 

To install Memgraph on Linux, you need to download the appropriate package from
the [Memgraph download page](https://memgraph.com/download). The installation
process is straightforward, and it is covered in the [Memgraph installation
guide](/getting-started/install-memgraph).


For a native Linux deployment, you can only use the base Memgraph package.
Currently, no Memgraph MAGE package is available for Linux. To run Memgraph MAGE
on Linux, you can use the Docker container. 

Once Memgraph is installed, you can use `systemd` to manage the Memgraph
service. Here is an example of how to start, stop, and restart the Memgraph
service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start memgraph
sudo systemctl stop memgraph
sudo systemctl restart memgraph
sudo systemctl status memgraph
```

## Connect to Memgraph

By default, Memgraph listens on port `7687` for the Bolt protocol. That means you
can connect to Memgraph using any of the [client libraries](/client-libraries)
or the [mgconsole](../getting-started/cli.mdx) CLI tool.

Memgraph pre-installs the `mgconsole` CLI tool, so you can connect to Memgraph
by running the following command:

```bash
mgconsole --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7687
```

You can use the `mgconsole` in interactive or non-interactive mode to set up the
Memgraph and run setup scripts. To connect to Memgraph from remote machines, you
need to change the `--host` parameter to the proper IP address. 

The same goes for using a client library, you need to provide the proper IP
address and port number. The client needs to be in the same network as the
Memgraph instance, or the instance, needs to be exposed to the internet.

If you are unable to connect to a remote Memgraph instance, keep in mind that
your firewall environment may be blocking the connection to Memgraph.

## Configure Memgraph

Memgraph has its configuration settings persisted in the `memgraph.conf` file
located in the `/etc/memgraph` folder. Some of the most commonly configured
settings are:

- `--log-level=WARNING`
- `--query-execution-timeout-sec=600`
- `--storage-snapshot-interval-sec=300  `
- `--storage-snapshot-retention-count=3`
- `--storage-mode=IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL`

Of course, other
[settings](../database-management/configuration.mdx#list-of-configuration-flags)
are as important, so make sure you get familiar with them as well.

To change the configuration settings, you need to open and edit the
`memgraph.conf` file and restart the Memgraph service. 

The set flags override the default settings in the `memgraph.conf` file. It is
also possible to provide an additional configuration file by providing a path to
it via `--file-flag` or `MEMGRAPH_CONFIG` environment variable. The set values
in that file will override values in the default `memgraph.conf` file. 

## Secure the database

In the community version of Memgraph, you can create a user and its password for
security. To achieve that, set `MEMGRAPH_USER` and `MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD`
environment variables. When you set values for those variables, a user will be
created if it does not exist, and no one except that user will be able to
access the database. 

To authenticate, provide the correct username and password. For example, if you
want to run Memgraph's CLI `mgconsole` on localhost, run the following command:

```bash
mgconsole --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7687 --username=user --password=pass
```

    />
</div>
</Cards>

In the Enterprise version of Memgraph, you can achieve a higher level of
security with role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained access
control. Within fine-grained access control Memgraph offers label-based access
control.

To set it up, first [enable Memgraph
Enterprise](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise), and then run
[the necessary Cypher
queries](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control)
to set up privileges properly.

You can add an additional layer of security by enabling SSL encryption.

## Data persistency 

Data persistence is a crucial aspect of running a database. You want to keep
your data Persistent if anything goes wrong. Memgraph stores different types of
information in different places. 

Here are the locations of the different types of data that Memgraph uses: 

- Configuration files: `/etc/memgraph`
- Logs: `/var/log/memgraph`
- User-related data: `/usr/lib/memgraph`
- Graph data: `/var/lib/memgraph`

Based on what you want to backup, consider copying any of the listed folders to
a safe location.

## Backup data

Memgraph uses  `snapshots` and `WAL files`
folders for [durability](../fundamentals/data-durability), they enable the database and graph to recover in case
of a crash. The snapshots and WAL files folders are good candidates for backup,
and they are part of the `/var/lib/memgraph` folder. 

If you want to restore the data, all you need to do is start a new Memgraph
instance with different data directories by using the `--data-directory` flag
and pointing it to a backup folder. 

Also, if you are using query modules and custom configuration files, make sure
to back them up as well. The query modules are stored in the
`/usr/lib/memgraph`. 


### Copy the data persistence folder 

The easiest and most reliable way to backup the graph data is to copy the whole
`/var/lib/memgraph` folder.  

First, run the following query in Memgraph to lock the data directory in order
to avoid changes happening during the backup process

```cypher
LOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
```

After that, copy the data persistency folder onto your local file system:

```bash
cp -rp /var/lib/memgraph /path/to/my/local-folder
```

Notice that the `-p` flag is used to preserve the file ownership and
permissions.

In the end, unlock the data directly by running the following query in Memgraph:

```cypher
UNLOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
```

### Dump database

Another approach is to dump the database into a file. This is useful if you want
to move the data between different Memgraph versions that might have
incompatible data formats are used for snapshots or wal files. 

To dump the database, you can use the `mgconsole` CLI tool. Here is an example
of how to dump the database into a file:

```bash
echo "DUMP DATABASE;" | mgconsole --output-format=cypherl > data.cypherl
```

Keep in mind that the `cypherl` format is used to dump the database. Whole graph
data is stored in the `data.cypherl` file, this means that the import process
can take a while since the entire graph data is stored in a single file. 

You should prefer copying the data persistency folder when possible over dumping
the database since it is significantly faster. 

## Restore data

Depending on the backup method you use, you can restore data in a different way.
If you have copied the data persistency folder, you can simply copy the folder
back to the custom location and start the Memgraph instance with the
`--data-directory` flag pointing to the restored folder. 

The backup data folder should be owned by the Memgraph user, so make sure the
folder is accessible for read and write operations by the Memgraph user. 

Putting the backup folder back to `/var/lib/` path is recommended since you will
avoid issues with ownership. 

If you have dumped the database, you can import the data back into Memgraph 
using the mgconsole CLI tool or the client library. Make sure you read the [best
practices for such
import](/data-migration/best-practices#cypher-queries-best-practices).


### Upgrading Memgraph

Keep in mind that between different versions of Memgraph, we might break the
compatibility of the configurations, snapshots, and WAL files. This is done very
rarely, but it is useful to keep an eye on the [release
notes](/release-notes) to see if there are any breaking
changes.

## Set up a cluster

To create a cluster, replicate data across several instances. Setting up
replication means running a couple of Memgraph instances on different
machines and connecting them to each other. One of the instances will be the
MAIN instance and others will be either SYNC or ASYNC replicas.

In order to set up the replication cluster, start memgraph instances on
different machines with `--replication-restore-state-on-startup` flag set to
`true`.

All started instances are MAIN upon starting. Two instances must be demoted to
REPLICA roles because only one instance can be MAIN. To do that, run the
following query on the second and third instances (REPLICA instances):

```cypher
SET REPLICATION ROLE TO REPLICA WITH PORT 10000;
```

Once the replica instances are in `REPLICA` role, you can connect them to MAIN
instance by running the following query from the MAIN instance:

```cypher
REGISTER REPLICA REP1 SYNC TO "<IP_ADDRESS_REP1>";
REGISTER REPLICA REP2 ASYNC TO "<IP_ADDRESS_REP2>";
```

If you have trouble connecting, check your firewall and network settings.

That's it, replication cluster with one MAIN, one SYNC REPLICA, and one ASYNC
REPLICA instance is set up. To learn more about the replication Memgraph, refer
to our [replication docs](/clustering/replication#set-up-a-replication-cluster). 

Setting up the replication cluster is great if you need to replicate data, add
load balancing, or improve availability. Still, to achieve high availability,
you need to manage automatic failover. On the other hand, Memgraph Enterprise
has a high availability feature included in the offering to ease the management
of the Memgraph cluster. In such cases, the cluster consists of MAIN instances,
REPLICA instances and COORDINATOR instances, which, backed up by Raft protocol,
manage the cluster state.

## Logging

At any point in your Memgraph instance lifecycle, you might need to check the
logs either to debug an issue or to monitor the performance. Memgraph logs are
stored in the `/var/log/memgraph` folder if the default location is not changed
by `--log-file` command. They are typically stored in the format
`memgraph_year-month-day.log`. 

You can control the log levels as described in the [logs
configuration](../database-management/logs.mdx) page. If you are setting up the
production environment, you should consider setting the log level to `INFO` or
`WARNING` to avoid the log files growing too large.

If you are experiencing some issues or you have trouble setting up the Memgraph
instance, consider setting the log level to `TRACE` to get more information
about the issue.

The best way to monitor logs is to attach the logs directly to your terminal as
you debug the issue. You can do that by running the following command:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/memgraph/memgraph_$(date +"%Y-%m-%d").log
```
