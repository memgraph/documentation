# Deploy Memgraph on AWS EC2 instance

This guide will show you how to deploy Memgraph on an AWS EC2 instance. The
guide will cover only the specific bits that are different from the general
deployment guide you can find for native [Linux](./linux.mdx) or
[Docker](./docker.mdx) deployments.

This guide assumes you have an AWS account and are familiar with the AWS
console. If you are not, you can follow the [AWS EC2
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html).


## Creating a new EC2 instance 

The first step is to have an EC2 instance running on AWS, where you will deploy
Memgraph. Here are some guidelines for opening a new EC2 instance for Memgraph. 

### Picking the OS 

When creating the EC2 instance, you need to pick the OS you wish to have on the
instance. If you are going to use the Memgraph native installation, you need to
pick a Linux distribution that Memgraph supports.

Memgraph supports multiple Linux distributions. Memgraph packages for supported distributions and versions can be downloaded 
from the [following page](/getting-started/install-memgraph/direct-download-links#linux)

Running Memgraph natively will bring some speed improvements compared to the
Docker version of Memgraph. 

If you are going to use the Memgraph Docker image, pick any Linux.

Memgraph in Docker can be deployed both on x86 and ARM architecture. All native
distributions work on x86 architecture. Some of the native distributions also
work on ARM architecture (Debian, Ubuntu), some do not (Centos, Fedora). Check
the [direct download
links](/getting-started/install-memgraph/direct-download-links#linux) for
detailed information.


### Picking the instance type

When creating the EC2 instance, you need to pick the instance type. If you run
Memgraph in `IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL` (default mode) or in
`IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL` storage mode, all data is stored in RAM. That means it
would be good first to calculate [how much memory you will
need](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#calculate-storage-memory-usage). There
is also an [easy-to-use
calulator](https://memgraph.com/enterprise#ram-calculator) for approximating
memory usage. The good rule of thumb is to have double the memory of what your
storage would take. You can go with less if you do not have a demanding
workload. A demanding workload would be a query that traverses half of the graph
and returns a lot of data.

AWS has specialized instances for [memory-optimized
workloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/mo.html) which
are designed for in-memory databases, data analytics, and other memory-intensive
applications. They provide a good cost per GB of RAM and performance for
Memgraph. Once you know how much memory you need, you can pick the instance from
the memory-optimized instance pools based on your data needs and budget. 

Instances vary based on the supported architectures, number of CPU cores,
network bandwidth, block storage, etc. All metrics typically scale with the
instance size. Memgraph is not demanding on rest of the metrics as long as there
is sufficent RAM. The basic R5 or X1 instances families are good starting points
for Memgraph. 

If you are running Memgraph in `ON_DISK_TRANSACTIONAL` storage mode, you need to
consider the instances [optimized for
storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/so.html).


### Setup the network

When creating the EC2 instance, you need to set up the [network access and
security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html). By default, Memgraph uses port 7687 for the Bolt protocol.
You need to open this port for TCP traffic and to allow connections to Memgraph. 

If you change the default Bolt port, make sure to update the security group
accordingly.

Also, if deploying Memgraph for
[Replication](/clustering/replication#replication) or [High
Availability](/clustering/high-availability#high-availability-enterprise), the
ports for the replication and cluster management should also be open. 
In replication configuration each instance needs to have an open port 10000 for the
replication. In a high availability configuration, each **data instance** needs to have an open
port of 10000 for management and a port of 20000 for replication. Each **coordinator
instance***, needs to have open port 12000. 

All instances need to have open port 7687 for the Bolt protocol.


### Setup the storage 

When creating the EC2 instance, you need to set up the storage. By default
Memgraph stores all data to working RAM, but for the [persistency between
restarts](../fundamentals/data-durability) Memgraph uses the disk storage to
store snapshots, configurations, etc.

It is recommended to use the [EBS volumes for
storage](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/instance-store-vs-ebs). EBS volumes
are durable, scalable, and can be attached to the EC2 instance. They will be
persistent even if the EC2 instance is stopped and restarted. Local storage can
be used, but it is not recommended for production use cases since data loss can
occur if the instance is stopped or terminated.

Faster storage (SSDs) can lead to speedier snapshot creation and recovery times,
which can be important on bigger scales (billion-sized graphs). Still, it is not
critical for the Memgraph operating performance. Magnetic storage can also be
used  
on smaller scales.


The storage size depends on the amount of data you are going to store in your
Memgraph instance and the number of active snapshots you want to keep alive.
Memgraph will periodically create snapshots of the data and store them on disk.
As the new snapshot is created, the oldest one is deleted. The number of
snapshots you want to keep alive is configurable in the Memgraph configuration
file.

The recommendation is to double the storage of the data you will store in
Memgraph. If you are going to store 100GB of data in Memgraph, you should have
at least 200GB of disk storage. 


## Installing Memgraph 

Depending on the way you want to deploy Memgraph, native or via Docker, you need
to follow the steps below: 

<Tabs items={["Docker" , "Linux"]}>

 <Tab> 
    For example, if you are using Amazon Linux 2, you can follow the steps
    below to install Docker:

        ```bash
        sudo yum update -y
        sudo yum install docker -y
        sudo systemctl start docker
        # Add the user to the docker group
        sudo usermod -a -G docker $(whoami)
        newgrp docker
        ```
    Note that the steps above may vary depending on your Linux distribution.

    After Docker is installed, you can pull the Memgraph image and run it:

        ```bash
        docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph:latest
        ```

    This will run Memgraph on the default port 7687. You should be able to connect
    to it via [Memgraph Lab](../data-visualization) or via [client
    libraries](../client-libraries) using the Bolt protocol. If you are experiencing issues while
    connecting to Memgraph remotely, make sure that the port 7687 is open in [the
    security group of your EC2 instance](#setup-the-network).

    Depending on the Linux distribution you are using, you can follow the guide for
    installing Memgraph on each distribution: 

        - [Ubuntu](../getting-started/install-memgraph/ubuntu.mdx)
        - [Fedora](../getting-started/install-memgraph/fedora.mdx)
        - [Debian](../getting-started/install-memgraph/debian.mdx)
        - [Centos](../getting-started/install-memgraph/centos.mdx)
        - [Amazon Linux](../getting-started/install-memgraph/amazon-linux.mdx)
        - [RedHat](../getting-started/install-memgraph/redhat.mdx)
        - [Rocky](../getting-started/install-memgraph/rocky.mdx)

    </Tab> 
 </Tabs>

## Manage Memgraph deployment

After Memgraph is installed and running on your EC2 instance, Memgraph
management in AWS is identical to the general guidelines that are described in
the form of a native Linux Memgraph or Docker container Memgraph. 

Depending on what you are using, you can follow the [Linux](./linux.mdx) or
[Docker](./docker.mdx) deployment guide for more information on how to manage
the Memgraph deployment.


## Where to next? 

Memgraph also supports deployment in the Kubernetes environment. If you are
interested in deploying Memgraph in Kubernetes, you can follow the [Memgraph
