# Workloads

When deploying Memgraph in production, it is essential to consider a set of
prerequisites to ensure optimal **performance**, **scalability** and
**resilience**. That includes decisions about hardware configurations and
integration strategies. 

This section provides guides that are the starting point to production-readiness
with Memgraph.

Before you dive into specific setups, it's important to think about:
- **Hardware requirements** and **instance sizing**
- **Driver configuration** 
- **Flags**  when starting Memgraph 
- **Data import** best practices
- Connecting to **external sources** 

These factors ensure Memgraph performs effectively in your environment, no
matter the use case.

## How to use these guides

**Start with the [Deployment best practices](/deployment/best-practices)**. That
page covers the **best practices** that apply to most production deployments,
regardless of your workload type and are **agnostic to specific use cases**.
Each separate guide in the Workloads section focuses on a particular type of
workload or deployment scenario. At the beginning of each guide, you’ll learn
when that **use case** is a good fit for your needs and specific tailored
**recommendations**.

<Callout type="warning">
Recommendations in those guides **override** anything written in the general
suggestions when there's a conflict, so always defer to the targeted guide when
applicable.
