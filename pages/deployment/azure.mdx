# Manage Memgraph in Azure Virtual machine (VM)

In this guide, we will show you how to deploy Memgraph on an Azure virtual machine.
The guide will cover only the specific bits that are different from the general
deployment guide you can find for native [linux](./linux.mdx) or
[docker](./docker.mdx) deployments.

This guide assumes you have an Azure account and are familiar with the Azure portal. 
If you are not, you can follow the [Azure Virtual machine quick start guide
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu).

## Crating a new Azure VM

The first step is to have an VM running on Azure, where you will deploy
Memgraph. Since Memgraph works nicly with Linux distributions it is recommended
to use linux based VMs. If there is need for Windows based VM, you can use
Memgraph with Docker on Windows VM. 

Below are some guidelines to consider if you are opening a new Azure VM for
Memgraph. 

### Picking the OS 

During the creation of the VM, you need to pick the OS you wish to
have on the VM. If you are going to use the Memgraph native installation,
you need to pick a Linux distribution that is supported by Memgraph.

The following Linux distributions are supported by Memgraph:

- Ubuntu (20.04, 22.04)
- Fedora (38, 39)
- Debian (11, 12) 
- Centos (7, 9) 
- Amazon Linux (2)
- RedHat (7, 9)
- Rocky (9.3)

This way you will manage the native installation of Memgraph which can bring
some of the speed benifits. 

If you are going to use the Memgraph Docker image, you can pick any Linux distribution or Windows, as long as you can run Docker on it.


### Picking the VM type

When creating the VM, you need to pick the VM type. The process
highly depends on your actuall workloads. For heavy graph processing, consider
using VM with more CPU and memory. 

Memgraph by default stors all data into the RAM, if you are going to use default storage mode (IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL), make a calculation [how
much data you will
need]((../fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#calculate-storage-memory-usage)). There is also an [easy to use calulator](https://memgraph.com/enterprise#ram-calculator) for aproximating memory usage. 
The rull of thumb is to have the double the memory of what your storage would
take. If you do not have demanding workload you can go with less. 

Azure has a spesilized instances for [memory optimized
workloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-memory) which
are designed for in-memory databases, data analytics, and other memory-intensive
applications. They also provide the DDR5 memory so you may consider using them
to optimize for better performance. 

### Network Setup

When creating the VM, you need to setup the network access and inbound port rules. By default
the Memgraph uses the port 7687 for the Bolt protocol. You need to open this
port for TCP traffic and to allow connections to Memgraph. 

If you change the default bolt port make sure to updated the inbound port rules accordingly.

Also, if deploying the Memgraph for a replication or clustering, the ports for
the replication and clustering should be open as well.

### Setup the storage 

When creating the VM, you need to setup the disk storage. By defult
Memgraph stores all data to working RAM, but for the [persistency between
restarts](../fundamentals/data-durability) Memgraph uses the disk storage to
store snapshots, configurations etc.

The sizing of the storage depends on the amount of data you are going to store
in your Memgraph database, and the quantitiy of the snapshots you want to keep
alive. 

The general rule of thumb is to have the double the storage then the amount of
data you are going to store. If you are going to store 100GB of data, you should
have at least 200GB of disk storage. 


## Installing Memgraph 

Depending on the way you want to deploy Memgraph, native or via Docker, you need to follow the 
steps below:

    <Tab>
     For example if you are using Ubuntu 20.04, you can follow the steps below to install Docker:

     ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
        sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
        docker --version
       
    ```
    Note that steps above may vary depending on the exact Linux distribution you are using.

    After the docker is installed, you can pull the Memgraph image and run it:

    ```bash
        docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph:latest
    ```

    This will run Memgraph on the default port 7687. You should be able to connect to it via 
    [Memgraph Lab](../data-visualization) or via [client libraries](../client-libraries) using 
    the bolt protocol. If you have issue connecting to Memgraph remotely, make sure that the port
    7687 is open in [the inbound roules on your Azure VM](#Setup-the-network).
    </Tab>

    <Tab>

    Depending on the Linux distribution you are using, you can follow the guide for installing Memgraph on each distribution: 

    - [Ubuntu](../getting-started/install-memgraph/ubuntu.mdx)
    - [Fedora](../getting-started/install-memgraph/fedora.mdx)
    - [Debian](../getting-started/install-memgraph/debian.mdx)
    - [Centos](../getting-started/install-memgraph/centos.mdx)
    - [Amazon Linux](../getting-started/install-memgraph/amazon-linux.mdx)
    - [RedHat](../getting-started/install-memgraph/redhat.mdx)
    - [Rocky](../getting-started/install-memgraph/rocky.mdx)

    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Manage Memgraph deployment

After Memgraph is installed and running on your Azure VM, Memgraph managment
in Azure VM is identical to the general guidlines that are described in form of a
native Linux Memgraph or Docker container Memgraph. 

Depending on what you are using, you can follow the [Linux](./linux.mdx) or
[Docker](./docker.mdx) deployment guide for more information on how to manage
the Memgraph deployment.


# Next steps

Memgraph also supports deployment in the Kubernetes environment. If you are are interested in deploying Memgraph in Kubernetes,
you can follow the [Memgraph Kubernetes installation guide](../getting-started/install-memgraph/kubernetes.mdx).
