# Deploying Memgraph to a native linux machine

After inital exploration of Memgraph possibilitys, this guide should help you out deploy 
Memgraph for running in production. 

Keep in mind that this is the subset of operations you could do with Memgraph but are typical operations
you want to ocaisonally perform in the production life-cycle of Memgraph. 


## Instalation process 

By looking into [install-memgraph](../getting-started/install-memgraph.mdx)
should contain a sufficent information for the installation proces. 


## Connecting to Memgraph

For connecting a client, mgconsole or Memgraph Lab to Memgraph it is sufficent
to provide the server IP adress and port Number, default port is 7687. 

Depending on your enviroment firewall and network configuration, you will probably need
to configure a firewall to enable TCP connection to a spcific port. 

Here is and example how to do it: 

```bash
sudo ufw allow 7687/tcp
```

## Putting your terminal to work (T2)

## Changing the Memgraph configuration  

Memgraph has a set of default [configuration
settings](../configuration/configuration-settings.mdx) that can be fine tuned
for specific needs.

The main Memgraph configuration file can be located in `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`. 

Each configuration setting is in the form:`--setting-name=value`.

The main Memgraph configuration file is available in
`/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`. You can modify that file to suit your specific
needs. Additional configuration can be specified by including another
configuration file, in a file pointed to by the `MEMGRAPH_CONFIG` environment
variable or by passing arguments on the command line.
