# Manage Memgraph with Docker 

Learn the best practices for managing your Memgraph instance in the Docker
environment.

## Install and run Memgraph with Docker

Memgraph offers two images you can run with Docker, depending on your needs:

- `memgraph/memgraph-mage` - use this image if you require [MAGE
  library](/advanced-algorithms) which consist of graph algorithms and util
  procedures. 
- `memgraph/memgraph` - use this image if you just require Memgraph database
  without MAGE library. This image is more lightweight but it does not include
  commonly used graph algorithms.

In this guide, we'll proceed with `memgraph/memgraph-mage` images for all examples,
but if you'd like to use `memgraph/memgraph` image, just replace it in the code
snippets.

The simplest way of running Memgraph in the Docker environment is using the
following command:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

Once you start, you'll see Memgraph logs in the terminal. To avoid logs showing up
in the terminal, you can run the container in detach mode (`-d` flag).

The above command starts Memgraph in a Docker container, and it exposes ports
`7687` and `7444`. The port `7687` is used to connect to the database and query it via the Bolt
protocol. The port `7444` is optional, but it's a good practice to use it, because
that's where the logs are exposed. Memgraph Lab, a visual user interface, uses
that port to note all logs in the UI. 

To connect to Memgraph, you can use CLI [mgconsole](/cli), preferred
[client](/client-libraries) or visual user interface [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization).

## Configure Memgraph

Memgraph has its configuration settings persisted in the `memgraph.conf` file
located in the `/etc/memgraph` folder. Some of the most commonly configured
settings are:

- `--log-level=WARNING`
- `--query-execution-timeout-sec=600`
- `--storage-snapshot-interval-sec=300	`
- `--storage-snapshot-retention-count=3`
- `--storage-mode=IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL`

Of course, other
[settings](/database-management/configuration#list-of-configuration-flags)
are as important, so make sure you get familiar with them as well.

Add the appropriate flags at the end of the command to configure Memgraph within the `docker run` command. For example, to change the log level to `TRACE` and to
remove query execution timeout, run the following command:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage --log-level=TRACE --query-execution-timeout-sec=0
```

The set flags override the default settings in the `memgraph.conf` file. It is
also possible to provide an additional configuration file by providing a path to it
via `--file-flag` or `MEMGRAPH_CONFIG` environment variable. The set values in
that file will override values in the default `memgraph.conf` file. Still, flags
in the `docker run` command will override them both, so be careful when
setting the configuration. To ensure all is set correctly, run `SHOW CONFIG`
once the database is up and running.

## Secure the database

In the community version of Memgraph, you can create a user and its password for security. 
To achieve that, set `MEMGRAPH_USER` and `MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD`
environment variables. When you set values for those variables, a user will be
created if it does not exist, and no one except from that user will be able to
access the database. Here is the command to start Memgraph with the user environment variables set:

```bash
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -e MEMGRAPH_USER="user" -e MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD="pass" memgraph/memgraph-mage 
```

To authenticate, provide the correct username and password. For example, if you
want to run Memgraph's CLI mgconsole, run the following command:

```bash
# Run docker ps to get CONTAINER_ID
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> mgconsole --username user --password pass
```

    <Card
    title="Learn more about users"
    href="/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/users"
    />
</div>
</Cards>

The other option is to start Memgraph with init flags, and you can read more
about it in the [configuration
guide](/database-management/configuration#use-init-flags-with-docker).

In the Enterprise version of Memgraph, you can achieve a higher level of security
with the role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained access control.
Within fine-grained access control Memgraph offers label-based access control.

To set it up, first [enable Memgraph
Enterprise](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise), and then run
[the necessary Cypher
queries](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control)
to set up privileges properly.

You can add an additional layer of security by enabling SSL encryption.

## Persist data with Docker volumes

Docker volumes are used for data persistence across container lifecycles, data
sharing between containers, efficient data storage, backup and migration and for
easy access from the host system. 

Whenever you restart your Docker container, the container's filesystem will
persist your data, logs and configuration. Still, data will not be persisted
across container deletion and recreation. To ensure you have your data even if
you decide to spin up a new container, run the container with volumes. 

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by
Docker containers. They are completely managed by Docker and are stored outside
of the default filesystem. The data in volumes is preserved across container
restarts and can be shared between multiple containers.

Although bind mounts, which allow you to attach specific paths from your host
machine to paths in the container, are also used for data persistence, they are
not a recommended option.

The best practice to ensure volume data persistence is to use named volumes and
to do regular backups.

Here are the locations of the different types of data that Memgraph uses:

- Configuration files: `/etc/memgraph`
- Logs: `/var/log/memgraph`
- User-related data: `/usr/lib/memgraph`
- Graph data: `/var/lib/memgraph`

Here is the command to run Memgraph with volumes for data persistency:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

Commonly, you want to ensure you have the same Memgraph configuration
wherever you start it. Then you can add volume for the configuration persistency
as well:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

If you'd like an easy access to logs on your machine, you can add volume for logs as well:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_etc:/etc/memgraph -v mg_log:/var/log/memgraph memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

Named volumes are Docker-managed volumes that store data independently of
containers. They are not directly mapped to a specific host directory that you
choose because, in this case, Docker manages where the data is stored on the
host. However, you can still access this data from the host.

As opposed to bind mounts, named volumes provide better encapsulation and
separation of the environment. Having named volumes makes it easier to back up or
migrate data. Since they're managed by Docker, there is an additional layer of
abstraction and security. Named volumes are more suitable for production
deployments, where security, data integrity, and portability are critical. 


If you want to start a new Memgraph instance with the data from another Docker
container which has `mg_lib` volume attached to it, you can run the following
command:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

The new container will be started with the contents from the `mg_lib` volume,
meaning it will restore the database from the existing snapshots. That's the
easiest way to transfer your data to another instance.

Additionally, here are some useful facts about Docker volumes:
- Two containers can't use the same volume at the same time: Be careful when
  you run a new Memgraph instance to change the name of the volume if you plan
  on running two Memgraph instances at the same time with different data.
- Two containers can use the same volume if they're not running at the same
  time: you can run a new Memgraph instance with an already used volume if you
  first stopped a previously running instance. That is useful when you want to
  reuse the same data for two instances.
- Using named volumes is the easiest way to migrate data between different containers.
- With named volumes, you can save files locally by inspecting the volume and
  saving the data to the local machine. With Docker Desktop, these actions are
  straightforward. Docker volumes can be inspected even when the container is
  down.

## Backup data

All your data is stored in the `/var/lib/memgraph` data folder. Although being
in-memory, Memgraph creates snapshots and WAL files to persist your data.
Because of that, it is a good practice to have a named volume on the
`/var/lib/memgraph` folder. That volume can be attached to a new instance, which
will then start with your data being loaded.

Still, it is a good practice to do a backup regularly.

### Copy the data persistence folder 

To create a backup, you need to copy the contents of `/var/lib/memgraph` folder.
If you previously set up the volume on `/var/lib/memgraph` data folder, then
just save the content from that volume on a safe location.

If you didn't run Memgraph with set up volumes, then copy the contents of
`/var/lib/memgraph` folder to a safe location. To do that, use `docker cp`
command. For example, to copy the whole data folder from Memgraph onto the local
file system, first run the following query in Memgraph to lock the data
directory to avoid changes happening during the backup process:

```
LOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
```

After that, copy the data folder onto your local file system:

```
docker cp <container_id>:/var/lib/memgraph /path/to/my/local-folder
```

In the end, unlock the data directory by running the following query in Memgraph:

```
UNLOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
```

By default, Memgraph creates snapshots every 300 seconds and retains three latest
snapshots, so it can easily recover in case of corruption. It is a good practice
to have more than one snapshot. If something caused the database to crash,
Memgraph will still be able to recover your data from the write-ahead logs. On
exit, Memgraph will create the latest snapshot. This can be
[configured](/database-management/configuration#storage), based on your dataset
size and use case. If your data is not being frequently updated, you can disable
periodic snapshot creation and create snapshots manually when you need to.

### Dump database

Another approach is to dump the database into a file. That is useful if you want
to move the data between different Memgraph versions that might have
incompatible data formats are used for snapshots or WAL files.

Here are the steps to dump the database with Memgraph running in a Docker container:

1. `docker exec -it -u 0 <container_id> bash`
2. `echo "DUMP DATABASE;" | mgconsole --output-format=cypherl > data.cypherl`
3. `docker cp <container_id>:data.cypherl data.cypherl`

The whole graph is dumped into a CYPHERL file, which consists of Cypher queries
used to create a database. 

It is a better practice to copy the data persistency folder when possible over dumping
the database since both the backup and restore processes are significantly faster.

## Restore data

Depending on the backup method you use, you can restore data differently.
If you set up a volume on `var/lib/memgraph` directory, then you can attach it
to the new container. If you didn't set up a volume on `var/lib/memgraph`
directory, then you need to copy the data folder's contents in the new
container in `var/lib/memgraph` directory.

The Memgraph user should own the backup data folder, so make sure the
folder is accessible for read and write operations by the Memgraph user.

If you have dumped the database, you can import the data back into Memgraph 
using the mgconsole CLI tool or the client library. Make sure you read the [best
practices for such
import](/data-migration/best-practices#cypher-queries-best-practices).


### Upgrading Memgraph

Between different versions of Memgraph, we might break the
compatibility of the configurations, snapshots, and WAL files. That is done very
rarely, but it is helpful to keep an eye on the [release notes](/release-notes)
to see if there are any breaking changes.

## Set up a cluster

To create a cluster, replicate data across several instances.
Setting up replication means running a couple of Memgraph instances,
where one of them is the MAIN instance, and others are either SYNC or ASYNC
replicas. 

Here is an example of setting up a replication cluster with three instances:

Run the instance on port 7687 (this instance will be MAIN):

```bash
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

Run another instance on port 7888 (this instance will be REPLICA):

```bash
docker run -p 7688:7687 -p 7445:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

Run the last instance on port 7689 (this instance will be REPLICA):

```bash
docker run -p 7689:7687 -p 7446:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

All started instances are MAIN upon starting. To set up a cluster, two instances must be demoted to REPLICA roles because only one instance can be MAIN.
To do that, run the following query from the second and third instance (REPLICA instances):

```cypher
SET REPLICATION ROLE TO REPLICA WITH PORT 10000;
```

To finish setting up the replication cluster, you need to register REPLICA instances from the MAIN instance with the correct IP addresses or DNS of REPLICA instances:
```cypher
REGISTER REPLICA REP1 SYNC TO "<IP_ADDRESS_REP1>";
REGISTER REPLICA REP2 ASYNC TO "<IP_ADDRESS_REP2>";
```

If you have trouble connecting, check your firewall settings.

That's it, replication cluster with one MAIN, one SYNC REPLICA and one ASYNC
REPLICA instance is set up. To learn more about the replication Memgraph, refer
to our [replication docs](/clustering/replication#set-up-a-replication-cluster). 

Having the replication cluster set up is great if you need to replicate data,
add load balancing or improve availability. Still, to achieve high availability,
you need to manage automatic failover. On the other hand, Memgraph Enterprise
has a high availability feature included in the offering to ease the management of
Memgraph cluster. In such case, the cluster consists of MAIN instance, REPLICA
instances and COORDINATOR instances, which, backed up by Raft protocol, manage
the cluster state.

## Logging

At any point in your Memgraph instance lifecycle, you might need to check the
logs either to debug an issue or to monitor the performance. Memgraph logs are
stored in the `/var/log/memgraph` folder if the default location is not changed
by the `--log-file` flag. They are typically stored in the format
`memgraph_year-month-day.log`.

You can control the log level as described on the [logs
page](/database-management/logs). If you are setting up the production
environment, you should consider setting the log level to `INFO` or `WARNING` to
avoid the log files growing too large.

If you are experiencing some issues or you have trouble setting up the Memgraph
instance, consider setting the log level to `TRACE` to get more information about
the issue.

If you created a volume on `/var/log/memgraph` folder, you can inspect it to access logs.

The best way to monitor logs is to attach the logs directly to your terminal as
you debug the issue. You can do that by running the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f <CONTAINER>
```

Because of flag `-f` or `--follow`, the above command will continue streaming the
new output from the container's `STDOUT` and `STDERR`.

More on the `docker logs` command can be found on the [Docker
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/logs/).

## Where to next?

Docker is a powerful tool, and it is usually a good starting point. If your
application involves multiple services besides a database, you might want to
create a multi-container application with Docker Compose. To learn more about
