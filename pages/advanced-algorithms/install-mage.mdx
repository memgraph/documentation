# Install MAGE graph algorithm library

Use MAGE with an instance installed within a [Docker container](#docker) or on
[Linux](#linux). 

The execution of graph algorithms can be accelerated with the GPU, by using the
[Memgraph X NVIDIA
cuGraph](#mage--nvidia-cugraph) version of the
library. 

## Docker

If you [install Memgraph with Docker](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker)
using `memgraph-platform` or `memgraph-mage` images the MAGE library is already
included and no additional installation is required to run the graph algorithms
on your data. 

<Callout type="info">

You can download a specific version of MAGE

For example, if you want to download version `1.1`, you should run the following
command:

```shell
docker run -p 7687:7687 -name memgraph memgraph/memgraph-mage:1.1
```

</Callout>

## Linux

Follow the steps if you want to use the MAGE library with [installed Linux based
Memgraph package](/getting-started/install-memgraph). 

<Steps>

### Make sure the instance is not running

Algorithms and query modules will be loaded into a Memgraph instance on startup
once you install MAGE, so make sure your instances are not running. 

### Install dependencies

To build from source, you will need:
- Python3
- Make
- CMake
- Clang
- UUID 
- [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

### Set up the machine

Run the following commands: 

```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libcurl4        `memgraph` \
    libpython${PY_VERSION}   `memgraph` \
    libssl-dev       `memgraph` \
    openssl         `memgraph` \
    build-essential `mage-memgraph` \
    cmake           `mage-memgraph` \
    curl            `mage-memgraph` \
    g++             `mage-memgraph` \
    python3         `mage-memgraph` \
    python3-pip     `mage-memgraph` \
    python3-setuptools     `mage-memgraph` \
    python3-dev     `mage-memgraph` \
    clang           `mage-memgraph` \
    git             `mage-memgraph` \
    --no-install-recommends \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
```

### Download the MAGE source code

Clone the [MAGE source code](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git
```


### Run the `setup` script

Run the following command: 

```shell
python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules
```

The script will generate a `dist` directory with all the needed files.

It will also copy the contents of the newly created `dist` directory to
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`. Memgraph loads algorithms and modules from
this directory. 

If something isn't installed properly, the `setup` script will stop the
installation process. If you have any questions, contact us on
**[Discord](https://discord.gg/memgraph).**

### Start a Memgraph instance

Algorithms and query modules will be loaded into a Memgraph instance on startup

If your instance was already running you will need to execute the following
query to load them:

```
CALL mg.load_all();
```

If your changes are not loaded, make sure to restart the instance by running
`systemctl stop memgraph` and `systemctl start memgraph`.

## MAGE × NVIDIA cuGraph on Docker

Follow this guide to install Memgraph with [**NVIDIA
cuGraph**](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph) GPU-powered graph algorithms.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

To be able to run cuGraph analytics, make sure you have compatible
infrastructure. The exact system requirements are available at the [**NVIDIA
RAPIDS site**](https://rapids.ai/start.html#requirements), and include an NVIDIA
Pascal (or better) GPU and up-to-date CUDA & NVIDIA drivers.

If you want to run MAGE × NVIDIA cuGraph in Docker, install:

- Docker
- Official [**NVIDIA driver**](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) for
  your operating system. 
- To run on NVIDIA-powered GPUs, RAPIDS requires Docker CE v19.03+ and
  [**nvidia-container-toolkit**](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)
  installed.
- Legacy Docker CE v17-18 users require the installation of the
  [**nvidia-docker2**](<https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation-(version-2.0)>)
  package.

### Download the image from Docker Hub

Pull the image and run it:

```shell
docker run --rm --gpus all -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage:1.3-cugraph-22.02-cuda-11.5
```

Depending on your environment, different versions of MAGE-cuGraph-CUDA can be
installed:

```shell
docker run --gpus all -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage:${MAGE_VERSION}-cugraph-${CUGRAPH_VERSION}-cuda-${CUDA_VERSION}
```

To see the available versions, explore Memgraph's Docker Hub and search for the
images tagged [**memgraph-mage**](https://hub.docker.com/r/memgraph/memgraph-mage/tags).

</Steps>

## MAGE × NVIDIA cuGraph on Linux

To use the MAGE × [**NVIDIA cuGraph**](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph) with
[installed Linux based Memgraph package](https://memgraph.com/download) you need
to install it natively from the source

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

To be able to run cuGraph analytics, make sure you have compatible
infrastructure. The exact system requirements are available at the [**NVIDIA
RAPIDS site**](https://rapids.ai/start.html#requirements), and include an NVIDIA
Pascal (or better) GPU and up-to-date CUDA & NVIDIA drivers.

If building MAGE × NVIDIA cuGraph locally, these requirements apply (tested on
Ubuntu):

If you want to build MAGE × NVIDIA cuGraph locally, install:

- Official [**NVIDIA driver**](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) for
  your operating system. 
- [**CMake**](https://cmake.org/) version above 3.20
- [**NVIDIA CUDA developer toolkit**](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
  – CUDA version 11.6
- System dependencies: `libblas-dev`, `liblapack-dev`, `libboost-all-dev`
- [**NVIDIA NCCL communications library**](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl)

### Make sure the instance is not running

Algorithms and query modules will be loaded into a Memgraph instance on startup
once you install MAGE, so make sure your instances are not running. 

### Download the source code

Download the MAGE source code from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/memgraph/mage):

```
git clone https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git
```

### Run the `setup` script

Run the script to generate a `dist` directory with all the needed files:
```shell
python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules --gpu
```

It will also copy the contents of the newly created `dist` directory to
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`.

The `--gpu` flag enables building the cuGraph dependencies and creating the
shared library with cuGraph algorithms that are loaded into Memgraph.

If something isn't installed properly, the `setup` script will stop the
installation process. If you have any questions, contact us on
**[Discord](https://discord.gg/memgraph).**

### Start a Memgraph instance

Algorithms and query modules will be loaded into a Memgraph instance on startup

If your instance was already running you will need to execute the following
query to load them:

```
CALL mg.load_all();
```

If your changes are not loaded, make sure to restart the instance by running
`systemctl stop memgraph` and `systemctl start memgraph`.
