# max_flow

The maximum flow problem consists of finding a flow through a graph such that it
is the maximum possible flow.

The algorithm implementation is based on the Ford-Fulkerson method with capacity
scaling. Ford-Fulkerson method is not itself an algorithm as it does not specify
the procedure of finding augmenting paths in a residual graph. It is a greedy
method, using augmenting paths as it comes across them. Input is a weighted
graph with a defined source and sink, representing the beginning and end of the
flow network. The algorithm begins with an empty flow and, at each step, finds a
path, called an augmenting path, from the source to the sink that generates more
flow. When flow cannot be increased anymore, the algorithm stops, and the maximum
flow has been found.

The capacity scaling is a heuristic for finding augmenting paths in such a way
that prioritizes taking edges with larger capacities, maintaining a threshold
value that is only lowered once no larger path can be found. It speeds up the
algorithm noticeably compared to a standard DFS search.

The algorithm is adapted to work with heterogeneous graphs, meaning not all
edges need to have the defined edge property used for edge flow. When an edge 
doesn't have a flow, it is skipped, and when no edges have this property, the
returning max flow value is 0.

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">

You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).

</Callout>

### `get_flow()`

Use the `get_flow()` procedure to calculate the maximum flow. 

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `start_v: Vertex` ➡ Source node from which the maximum flow is calculated.
- `end_v: Vertex` ➡ Sink node to which the max flow is calculated.
- `edge_property: string (default="weight")` ➡ Relationship property which is used as the flow
  capacity of the relationship. 

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `max_flow: Number` ➡ Maximum flow of the network, from the source node to the sink node.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To calculate the maximum flow, use the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (source {id: 0}), (sink {id: 5})
CALL max_flow.get_flow(source, sink, "weight")
YIELD max_flow
RETURN max_flow;
```

### `get_paths()`

The `get_paths()` procedure returns paths that are a part of the flow with the maximum flow. 

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `start_v: Vertex` ➡ Source node from which the maximum flow is calculated.
- `end_v: Vertex` ➡ Sink node to which the max flow is calculated.
- `edge_property: string (default="weight")` ➡ Relationship property which is used as the flow
  capacity of the relationship.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `path: Path` ➡ The path with a flow in a maximum flow.
- `flow: Number` ➡ The flow amount corresponding to that path.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To get the paths creating the maximum flow, use the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (source {id: 0}), (sink {id: 5})
CALL max_flow.get_paths(source, sink, "weight")
YIELD path, flow
RETURN path, flow;
```

## Example

{<h3> Database state </h3>} 

The database contains the following data: 

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/max_flow/max-flow-1.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
MERGE (a:Node {id: "A"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "B"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 9}]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: "A"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "C"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 10}]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: "B"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "E"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 8}]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: "C"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "F"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 7}]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: "C"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "D"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 1}]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: "A"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "D"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 8}]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: "E"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "D"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 2}]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: "D"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "F"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 11}]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: "E"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "G"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 5}]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: "F"}) MERGE (b:Node {id: "G"}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION {weight: 14}]->(b);
```

{<h3> Calculate maximum flow </h3>} 

Calculate the maximum flow using the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (source {id: "A"}), (sink {id: "G"})
CALL max_flow.get_flow(source, sink)
YIELD max_flow
RETURN max_flow;
```
