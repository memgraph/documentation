# degree_centrality

**Degree centrality** is the basic measurement of centrality that refers to the
number of relationships adjacent to a node. For directed graphs, define an
in-degree measure, which is defined as the number of in-coming edges, and an
out-degree measure, defined as the number of out-going edges.

Let $A = (a_{i,j})$ be the adjacency matrix of a directed graph. The in-degree
centrality $x_{i}$ of node $i$ is given by: $x_{i} = \sum_k a_{k,i}$ or in
matrix form (1 is a vector with all components equal to unity): $x = 1 A$. The
out-degree centrality $y_{i}$ of node $i$ is given by: $y_{i} = \sum_k
a_{i,k}$ or in matrix form: $y = A 1$.

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">
You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).
</Callout>

### `get()`

The procedure calculates the degree centrality for each node in the graph.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `type: string (default="undirected")` ➡ Defines whether the procedure is using "in", "out", or "undirected" relationships.


{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `node: Vertex` ➡ Node in the graph, for which Degree Centrality is calculated.
- `degree: float` ➡ Calculated degree of a node.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

The following query calculates the degree centralitry:

```cypher
CALL degree_centrality.get()
YIELD node, degree;
```

### `get_subgraph()`

The procedure calculates degree centrality for each node of the given subgraph.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `nodes: list[node]` ➡ Nodes that will be used in the algorithm.
- `relationships: list[relationship]` ➡ Relationships that will be considered for 
degree calculation.
- `type: string (default="undirected")` ➡ Defines whether the procedure is using
"in", "out", or "undirected" relationships.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `node: Vertex` ➡ Node in the graph, for which degree centrality is calculated.
- `degree: float` ➡ Calculated degree of a node.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

The following query calculates degree centrality on a subgraph:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Person)
CALL degree_centrality.get()
YIELD node, degree;
```

## Example

<Steps>

{<h3> Database state </h3>} 

The database contains the following data: 

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/degree_centrality/memgraph-degree-centrality.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
MERGE (a:Node {id: 1}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 0}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 1}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 10}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 2}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 1}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 2}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 10}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 2}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 8}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 10}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 4}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 4}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 10}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 5}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 5}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 10}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 6}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 7}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 8}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 8}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 10}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 9}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 10}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 10}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 9}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
```

{<h3> Calculate centrality </h3>} 

Get the values using the following query:

```
CALL degree_centrality.get("in")
YIELD node, degree
RETURN node, degree;
```

Results:

```
+------------------+------------------+
| node             | degree           |
+------------------+------------------+
| (:Node {id: 1})  | 0.1              |
| (:Node {id: 0})  | 0.1              |
| (:Node {id: 10}) | 0.7              |
| (:Node {id: 2})  | 0.5              |
| (:Node {id: 8})  | 0.1              |
| (:Node {id: 3})  | 0                |
| (:Node {id: 4})  | 0                |
| (:Node {id: 5})  | 0                |
| (:Node {id: 6})  | 0                |
| (:Node {id: 7})  | 0                |
| (:Node {id: 9})  | 0.1              |
