# degree_centrality


**Degree Centrality** is the basic measurement of centrality that refers to the
number of edges adjacent to a node. For directed graphs, we define an in-degree
measure, which is defined as the number of in-coming edges, and an out-degree
measure, defined as the number of out-going edges.

Let $A = (a_{i,j})$ be the adjacency matrix of a directed graph. The in-degree centrality $x_{i}$ of node $i$ is given by: $$x_{i} = \sum_k a_{k,i}$$ or in matrix form (1 is a vector with all components equal to unity): $$x = 1 A$$ The out-degree centrality $y_{i}$ of node $i$ is given by: $$y_{i} = \sum_k a_{i,k}$$ or in matrix form: $$y = A 1$$

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">
You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).
</Callout>

### `get(type)`

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `node` ➡ Node in the graph, for which Degree Centrality is calculated.
- `degree` ➡ Calculated degree of a node.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

```cypher
CALL degree_centrality.get()
YIELD node, degree;
```

### `get_subgraph(nodes, relationships, type)`

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `nodes: list[node]` ➡ nodes to be used in the algorithm.
- `relationships: list[relationship]` ➡ relationships to be considered for 
degree calculation.
- `type: string (default="undirected")` ➡ whether we are using "in", "out", or 
"undirected" edges.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `node` ➡ Node in the graph, for which Degree Centrality is calculated.
- `degree` ➡ Calculated degree of a node.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

```cypher
CALL degree_centrality.get()
YIELD node, degree;
```
