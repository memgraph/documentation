The `neighbors` module provides tools for users to interact with and query nodes
that have direct relationships to a specified node, enabling an examination of
the immediate connections within the graph and thereby gaining insights into the
network structure and connectivity.

## Procedures

### `at_hop()`

Returns nodes that are at a specific distance from a given node, considering only the relationships of a specified type.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `node: Node` ➡ The target node of neighborhood analysis.
- `rel_type: List[string]` ➡  A list of relationship types to travel through. If
  the list is empty, the procedure will return all types of relationships.
- `distance: int` ➡ The number of hops between nodes.

If &lt; is added in front of the relationship type, only relationships coming
into the node will be checked (e.g., "&lt;KNOWS"), while if > is added at the
end of the relationship type, only relationships coming from the node will be
checked (e.g., "KNOWS>"). Furthermore, if the relationship type is not relevant,
it is possible to enter only &lt; or > to check ingoing or outgoing
relationships.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `nodes: Node` ➡ Nodes at a specific distance from a given node.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

The following query will analysis the neighborhood of the persone nodes that are
3 hops away along the `KNOWS` relationship:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)
CALL neighbors.at_hop(p, ["KNOWS"], 3) YIELD nodes RETURN nodes;
```

### `by_hop()`

Returns nodes that are at any or up to a specific distance from a given node,
considering only the relationships of a specified type.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `node: Node` ➡ The target node of neighborhood analysis.
- `rel_type: List[string]` ➡ A list of relationship types to travel through. If
  the list is empty, the procedure will return all types of relationships.
- `distance: int` ➡ The maximum number of hops between nodes.

If &lt; is added in front of the relationship type, only relationships coming
into the node will be checked (e.g., &lt;KNOWS), while if {'>'} is added at the
end of the relationship type, only relationships coming from the node will be
checked (e.g., "KNOWS>"). Furthermore, if the relationship type is not relevant,
it is possible to enter only &lt; or > to check ingoing or outgoing
relationships.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `nodes: List[Node]` ➡ A list of nodes at a specific distance from a given node, starting from distance 1 up to the provided distance.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

The following query will analysis the neighborhood of the persone nodes that are
up to 3 hops away along the `KNOWS` relationship:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)
CALL neighbors.by_hop(p, ["KNOWS"], 3) YIELD nodes RETURN nodes;
```

## Example

<Steps>

{<h3> Database state </h3>} 

The database contains the following data: 

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/neighbors/neighbors.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
MERGE (a:Rachel) MERGE (b:Monica) CREATE (a)-[f:FRIENDS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Monica) MERGE (b:Ross) CREATE (a)-[f:FRIENDS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Monica) MERGE (b:Chandler) CREATE (a)-[f:LOVERS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Chandler) MERGE (b:Joey) CREATE (a)-[f:FRIENDS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Monica) MERGE (b:Phoebe) CREATE (a)-[f:FRIENDS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Rachel) MERGE (b:Ross) CREATE (a)-[f:LOVERS]->(b);
```
    
{<h3> Analyse neighborhood specific hops away </h3>} 

Use the following query to get the neighbor nodes that are 3 hops away from
the `Pheobe` node along all the possible relationships:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Phoebe)
CALL neighbors.at_hop(p, [""], 3) YIELD nodes
RETURN nodes
```

The results should be identical to the ones below, except for the
`id` values that depend on the internal database `id` values:

```plaintext
+----------------------------+
| nodes                      |
+----------------------------+
| {                          |    -> node at hop 3 with no relationship
|     "id": 1,               |       types specified
|     "labels": [            |
|        "Joey"              |
|     ],                     |
|     "properties": {},      |
|     "type": "node"         |
| }                          |
+----------------------------+

```

{<h3> Analyse neighborhood up to a certain hops away </h3>} 

Use the following query to get the neighbor nodes that are up to 3 hops away
from the `Pheobe` node along all the possible relationships:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Phoebe)
CALL neighbors.by_hop(p, ["FRIENDS"], 3) YIELD nodes
RETURN nodes
```

The results should be identical to the ones below, except for the
`id` values that depend on the internal database `id` values:

```plaintext
+----------------------------+
| nodes                      |
+----------------------------+
| [{                         |    -> list of nodes at hop 1
|     "id": 1,               |
|     "labels": [            |
|        "Monica"            |
|     ],                     |
|     "properties": {},      |
|     "type": "node"         |
| }]                         |
+----------------------------+
| [{                         |    -> list of nodes at hop 2
|     "id": 2,               |
|     "labels": [            |
|        "Ross"              |
|     ],                     |
|     "properties": {},      |
|     "type": "node"         |
| }, {                       |
|     "id": 3,               |
|     "labels": [            |
|        "Rachel"            |
|     ],                     |
|     "properties": {},      |
|     "type": "node"         |
| }]                         |
+----------------------------+
| []                         |    -> list of nodes at hop 3
+----------------------------+
```
