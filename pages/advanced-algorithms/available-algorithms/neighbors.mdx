# neighbors 

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'



The `neighbors` module provides tools for users to interact with and query nodes that have direct relationships to a specified node, enabling an examination of the immediate connections within the graph and thereby gaining insights into the network structure and connectivity.

## Procedures

### `at_hop(node, rel_type, distance)`

Returns nodes that are at a specific distance from a given node, considering only the relationships of a specified type.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `node: Node` ➡ node for which neighborhood is being analyzed.
- `rel_type: List[string]` ➡ list of relationship types to travel through; if empty, it is possible to travel through all types of relationships.
- `distance: int` ➡ number of hops between nodes.

If &lt; is added in front of the relationship type, only relationships coming into the node will be checked (e.g., "&lt;KNOWS"), while if > is added at the end of the relationship type, only relationships coming from the node will be checked (e.g., "KNOWS>"). Furthermore, if the relationship type is not relevant, it is possible to enter only &lt; or > to check ingoing or outgoing relationships.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `nodes: Node` ➡ nodes at a specific distance from a given node.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)
CALL neighbors.at_hop(p, ["KNOWS"], 3) YIELD nodes RETURN nodes;
```


### `by_hop(node, rel_type, distance)`

Returns nodes that are at any or up to a specific distance from a given node, considering only the relationships of a specified type.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `node: Node` ➡ node for which neighborhood is being analyzed.
- `rel_type: List[string]` ➡ list of relationship types to travel through; if empty, it is possible to travel through all types of relationships.
- `distance: int` ➡ maximum number of hops between nodes.

If &lt; is added in front of the relationship type, only relationships coming into the node will be checked (e.g., &lt;KNOWS), while if {'>'} is added at the end of the relationship type, only relationships coming from the node will be checked (e.g., "KNOWS>"). Furthermore, if the relationship type is not relevant, it is possible to enter only &lt; or > to check ingoing or outgoing relationships.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `nodes: List[Node]` ➡ list of nodes at a specific distance from a given node, starting from distance 1 up to a provided distance.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)
CALL neighbors.by_hop(p, ["KNOWS"], 3) YIELD nodes RETURN nodes;
```


## Example - neighbors.at_hop

<Steps>

### Cypher load commands

You can create a simple graph database by running the following queries:

```cypher
MERGE (a:Rachel) MERGE (b:Monica) CREATE (a)-[f:FRIENDS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Monica) MERGE (b:Ross) CREATE (a)-[f:FRIENDS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Monica) MERGE (b:Chandler) CREATE (a)-[f:LOVERS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Chandler) MERGE (b:Joey) CREATE (a)-[f:FRIENDS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Monica) MERGE (b:Phoebe) CREATE (a)-[f:FRIENDS]->(b);
MERGE (a:Rachel) MERGE (b:Ross) CREATE (a)-[f:LOVERS]->(b);
```

### Input graph

The image below shows the above data as a graph:

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/neighbors/neighbors.png)
    
### Run commands

```cypher
MATCH (p:Phoebe)
CALL neighbors.at_hop(p, [""], 3) YIELD nodes
RETURN nodes
```

### Results

The results should be identical to the ones below, except for the
`id` values that depend on the internal database `id` values:

```plaintext
+----------------------------+
| nodes                      |
+----------------------------+
| {                          |    -> node at hop 3 with no relationship
|     "id": 1,               |       types specified
|     "labels": [            |
|        "Joey"              |
|     ],                     |
|     "properties": {},      |
|     "type": "node"         |
| }                          |
+----------------------------+
