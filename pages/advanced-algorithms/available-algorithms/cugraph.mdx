# cugraph

**NVIDIA cuGraph** is a graph analytics library that is part of NVIDIA’s
[**RAPIDS**](https://rapids.ai/) open-source data science suite containing
machine learning tools and libraries for various applications in data science.
It can be used from Memgraph on machines that meet the [**system
requirements**](https://rapids.ai/start.html#requirements).

This set of modules is built on top of NVIDIA cuGraph and provides a set of
wrappers for most of the algorithms present in the
[**cuGraph**](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph) repository.

Find HITS authority and hub values for all nodes in the graph. The HITS
algorithm computes two numbers for each node: its _authority_, which estimates
the value of its content, and its _hub value_, which estimates the value of its
links to other nodes.

does not check if the input graph is directed and will execute on undirected
graphs.

  supported by NVIDIA cuGraph).
- `max_iterations: integer (default=100)` ➡ Maximum number of iterations before returning an
