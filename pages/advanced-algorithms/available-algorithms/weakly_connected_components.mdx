# weakly_connected_components

The first analysis that is most often run on a graph is usually a search for
disconnected components. The algorithm implemented within this module does
exactly that, it searches for different components of the graph. Within
components, nodes have connections toward each other, while between components
there is no edge that connects nodes from separate components.

| **Module type**     | algorithm  |

| **Graph direction** | undirected |

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">

You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).

</Callout>

### `get()`

Use the procedure to get disconnected componentes.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `node` ➡ Vertex object with all properties which is going to be related to the
  component ID it belongs.
* `component_id` ➡ Component ID for each node in the graph. Components are
  zero-indexed and there is no rule of how they will be appointed to node. The
  only guarantee is that divided components will have distinct component IDs.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Run the following query to get disconnected components:

```cypher
CALL weakly_connected_components.get()
YIELD node, component_id;
```

## Example

<Steps>

{<h3> Database state </h3>} 

The database contains the following data: 

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/weakly_connected_components/weakly-connected-components-1.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
MERGE (a:Node {id: 0}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 1}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 1}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 2}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 0}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 3}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 4}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 5}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
```

{<h3> Analyze graph </h3>} 

Get weekly connected components by running the following query:

```cypher
CALL weakly_connected_components.get()
YIELD node, component_id
RETURN node, component_id;
```

Results:

```plaintext
+-----------------+-----------------+
| node            | component_id    |
+-----------------+-----------------+
| (:Node {id: 5}) | 1               |
| (:Node {id: 4}) | 1               |
| (:Node {id: 3}) | 1               |
| (:Node {id: 2}) | 0               |
| (:Node {id: 0}) | 0               |
| (:Node {id: 1}) | 0               |
+-----------------+-----------------+
