# pagerank

If we present nodes as pages and directed relationships between them as links, the
**PageRank** algorithm outputs a probability distribution used to represent the
likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any
particular page.

**PageRank** theory holds that an imaginary surfer who is randomly clicking on
links will eventually stop clicking. The probability, at any step, that the
person will continue randomly clicking on links is called a damping factor,
otherwise, the next page is chosen randomly among all pages.

**PageRank** is computed iteratively using the following formula:

```
Rank(n, t + 1) = (1 - d) / number_of_nodes
                + d * sum { Rank(in_neighbour_of_n, t) /
                out_degree(in_neighbour_of_n)}
```

Where `Rank(n, t)` is **PageRank** of node `n` at iteration `t`. In the end, *rank*
values are **normalized** to sum 1 to form a probability distribution.

The algorithm is implemented in such a way that all available **threads** are
used to calculate PageRank, mostly for scalability purposes.

Default arguments are equal to default arguments in
[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank.html)
PageRank implementation.

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">
You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).
</Callout>

### `get()`

The procedure calculates the PageRank. 

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.

* `max_iterations: integer (default=100)` ➡ Maximum number of iterations within PageRank
  algorithm.
* `damping_factor: double (default=0.85)` ➡ PageRanks damping factor. This is the
  probability of continuing the random walk from a random node within the graph.
* `stop_epsilon: double (default=1e-5)` ➡ Value used to terminate the iterations of
  PageRank. If change from one iteration to another is lower than
  *stop_epsilon*, execution is stopped.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `node` ➡ Node in the graph, for which PageRank is calculated.
* `rank` ➡ Normalized ranking of a node. Expresses the probability that a random
  surfer will finish in a certain node by a random walk.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

The following query calculated the PageRank:

```cypher
CALL pagerank.get()
YIELD node, rank;
```

## Example

<Steps>

{<h3> Database state </h3>} 

The database contains the following data: 

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/pagerank/memgraph-pagerank.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
MERGE (a:Node {id: 1}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 0}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 2}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 0}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 0}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 4}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 0}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 5}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 0}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 6}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 0}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 0}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 7}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
```

{<h3> Calculate PageRank </h3>} 

Calculate PageRank using the following query:

```cypher
CALL pagerank.get()
YIELD node, rank
RETURN node, rank;
```

Results:
