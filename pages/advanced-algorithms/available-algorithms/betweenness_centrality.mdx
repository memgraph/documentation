# betweenness_centrality

In network studies, centrality analysis illuminates the significance of nodes,
with betweenness centrality being one of the most important metrics. It
determines the importance of a node based on how frequently it lies on the
shortest paths between other nodes, signifying its influence on information flow
within the network. Such nodes, possessing high betweenness, often act as
gatekeepers in controlling the transmission of information.

While the concept of betweenness centrality revolves around shortest paths,
defined by the fewest relationships or minimal cumulative relationship weight in
weighted graphs, the calculation methodologies can vary. One notable method is
described in the paper ["A Faster Algorithm for Betweenness
Centrality"](http://www.uvm.edu/pdodds/research/papers/others/2001/brandes2001a.pdf)(Jamour
et al., 2017).

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">
You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).
</Callout>

### `get(directed, normalized, threads)`

#### Input:

- `directed: boolean (default=True)` ➡ If `False` the direction of the edges is ignored.
- `normalized: boolean (default=True)` ➡ If `True` the betweenness values are normalized by
  `2/((n-1)(n-2))` for graphs, and `1/((n-1)(n-2))` for directed graphs where
  `n` is the number of nodes.
- `threads: integer (default=number of concurrent threads supported by the
  implementation)` ➡ The number of threads used to calculate betweenness
  centrality.

#### Output:

- `betweenness_centrality: float` ➡ Value of betweenness for a given node.

- `node: Vertex` ➡ Graph vertex for betweenness calculation.

#### Usage:

```cypher
CALL betweenness_centrality.get()
YIELD node, betweenness_centrality;
```
