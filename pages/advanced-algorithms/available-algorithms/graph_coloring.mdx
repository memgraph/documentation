# graph_coloring

Graph coloring is the assignment of colors to nodes such that two nodes
connected with a relationship don’t have the same color. The goal is to minimize
the number of colors while correctly coloring a graph.

Algorithm implementation is inspired by "[Quantum Annealing
(QA)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-22000-5_57)", a
simple metaheuristic frequently used for solving discrete optimization problems.

QA is a simple strategy for exploring a solution space. The main idea is to
start a search with several possible solutions. These solutions change through
iterations and produce new “better” solutions. Each solution has a particular
error value which depends on the error function that the algorithm optimizes. In
the graph coloring scenario, the error function is often defined as the number
of edges connecting nodes with the same color.

The algorithm is iterative. It applies several simple rules to change solutions
in a loop (the same rules are applied multiple times). The algorithm terminates
when a stop criterion is met, usually when the error becomes zero. One of the
rules could be to randomly select the node involved in a conflict and change its
colors.

Changes made in one iteration may not be permanent if they don’t improve the
solution. But, with a certain probability, the new solution is accepted even if
its error is not reduced. In that way, the algorithm is prevented from
converging to local minimums too early.

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">
You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).
</Callout>

### `color_graph()`

The procedure assigns colors to nodes in the whole graph such that two nodes
connected with a relationship don’t have the same color.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.

- `parameters: Dict[string, Any] (default={})` ➡ A dictionary that specifies the algorithm configuration by listing [parameters](#parameters).
- `edge_property: string (default=weight)` ➡ Relationship property that stores the relationship weight. Any relationship attribute not present defaults to 1.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `node: Vertex` ➡ Represents the node.
- `color: int` ➡ Represents the assigned color.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Use the following query assign colors:

```cypher
CALL graph_coloring.color_graph()
YIELD node, color;
```

### ` color_subgraph()`

The procedure assigns colors to nodes in a subgraph such that two nodes
connected with a relationship don’t have the same color.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.

- `vertices: List[Vertex]` ➡ List of vertices in the subgraph.
- `edges: List[Edge]` ➡ List of relationships in the subgraph.
- `parameters: Dict[string, Any] (default={})` ➡ A dictionary that specifies the algorithm configuration by listing [parameters](#parameters).
- `edge_property: string (default=weight)` ➡ Relationship property that stores the relationship weight. Any relationship attribute not present defaults to 1.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `node: Vertex` ➡ Represents the node.
- `color: int` ➡ Represents the assigned color.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Use the following query to assign colors on a subgraph:

```cypher
MATCH (a)-[e]->(b)
WITH collect(a) as nodes, collect (e) as edges
CALL graph_coloring.color_subgraph(nodes, edges, {no_of_colors: 2})
YIELD node, color;
```

```cypher
MERGE (a:Node {id: 0}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 1}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 1}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 1}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 4}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 5}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 5}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 6}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 7}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 5}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 8}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 9}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 9}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 10}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 8}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 3}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 0}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 6}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 6}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 8}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 0}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 8}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 2}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 4}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 1}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 10}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 10}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 7}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
```

{<h3> Apply graph coloring </h3>} 

Get the values using the following query:

```cypher
CALL graph_coloring.color_graph({no_of_colors: 4})
YIELD node, color
RETURN node, color;
```
