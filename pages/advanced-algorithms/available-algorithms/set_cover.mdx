# set_cover

**The Set Cover** problem is one of the problems in graph theory that tries to
solve the least possible set of sets that covers all elements inside those sets.
Given a set of *n* elements, and a collection of *m* sets containing them, the
algorithm tries to identify the **smallest sub-collection** of sets whose union
equal to all the elements. It is *NP-complete*, however solvable with techniques
such as constraint programming. The current algorithm uses *GEKKO* optimizer as
a constraint programming solver.

Too slow?

If this algorithm implementation is too slow for your use case, open an issue on [Memgraph's GitHub repository](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/issues) and request a rewrite to C++!

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">

You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).

</Callout>

### `cp_solve()`

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

The input itself represents an *element-set* pair with each row of the lists.

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `element_vertexes: List[Vertex]` ➡ List of element nodes in pairs.
- `set_vertexes: List[Vertex]` ➡ List of set nodes in pairs.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `containing_set` ➡ The minimal set of sets in which all the elements are contained.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To get the minimal set of sets, run the following query:

```cypher
CALL set_cover.cp_solve([(:Point), (:Point)], [(:Set), (:Set)])
YIELD containing_set;
```

## `greedy()`

The greedy algorithm quickly selects local optima without guaranteeing a global
optimum. So, not bad, not terrible.

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.

- `set_vertexes: List[Vertex]` ➡ List of set nodes in pairs.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `containing_set` ➡ The minimal set of sets in which all the elements are contained.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To get the minimal set of sets using the greedy algorithm, run the following query:

```cypher
CALL set_cover.greedy([(:Point), (:Point)], [(:Set), (:Set)])
YIELD containing_set;
```

## Example

<Steps>

{<h3> Database state </h3>} 

The database contains the following data: 

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/set_cover/set-cover-1.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
CREATE (e:AnimalSpecies {name: 'Snake'});
CREATE (e:AnimalSpecies {name: 'Bear'});
CREATE (e:AnimalSpecies {name: 'Falcon'});
CREATE (e:AnimalSpecies {name: 'Beaver'});
CREATE (e:AnimalSpecies {name: 'Fox'});

CREATE (s:NationalPark {name: 'Yosemite'});
CREATE (s:NationalPark {name: 'Grand Canyon'});
CREATE (s:NationalPark {name: 'Yellowstone'});
CREATE (s:NationalPark {name: 'Glacier'});
CREATE (s:NationalPark {name: 'Everglades'});

MATCH (e: AnimalSpecies {name: 'Snake'}), (s:NationalPark {name: 'Yosemite'})
CREATE (e)-[:LIVES_IN]->(s);
MATCH (e: AnimalSpecies {name: 'Bear'}), (s:NationalPark {name: 'Yosemite'})
CREATE (e)-[:LIVES_IN]->(s);
MATCH (e: AnimalSpecies {name: 'Falcon'}), (s:NationalPark {name: 'Yosemite'})
CREATE (e)-[:LIVES_IN]->(s);
MATCH (e: AnimalSpecies {name: 'Beaver'}), (s:NationalPark {name: 'Yosemite'})
CREATE (e)-[:LIVES_IN]->(s);

MATCH (e: AnimalSpecies {name: 'Fox'}), (s:NationalPark {name: 'Yellowstone'})
CREATE (e)-[:LIVES_IN]->(s);
MATCH (e: AnimalSpecies {name: 'Beaver'}), (s:NationalPark {name: 'Yellowstone'})
CREATE (e)-[:LIVES_IN]->(s);

MATCH (e: AnimalSpecies {name: 'Snake'}), (s:NationalPark {name: 'Glacier'})
CREATE (e)-[:LIVES_IN]->(s);
MATCH (e: AnimalSpecies {name: 'Bear'}), (s:NationalPark {name: 'Glacier'})
CREATE (e)-[:LIVES_IN]->(s);

MATCH (e: AnimalSpecies {name: 'Falcon'}), (s:NationalPark {name: 'Everglades'})
CREATE (e)-[:LIVES_IN]->(s);
```

{<h3> Get minimal set of sets </h3>} 

To get the minimal set of sets, run the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (e:AnimalSpecies)-[l:LIVES_IN]-(s:NationalPark)
WITH collect(e) AS animal_list, collect(s) AS park_list
CALL set_cover.cp_solve(animal_list, park_list)
YIELD containing_set
WITH containing_set AS national_park
MATCH (animal:AnimalSpecies)-[l:LIVES_IN]->(national_park)
RETURN animal, l, national_park;
```
