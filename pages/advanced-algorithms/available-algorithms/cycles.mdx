# cycles

In graph theory, a cycle represents a path within the graph where only the
starting and ending nodes are equal. Furthermore, cycles can be double-connected
links between neighboring nodes or self-loops. The cycles detection algorithm
implemented within MAGE works on an undirected graph and has **no guarantee** of
node order in the output. The implemented algorithm (Gibb) is described in the
1982 MIT report called "[Algorithmic approaches to circuit enumeration problems
and applications](http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/68106)" (Boon Chai Lee, 1982).
The problem is not solvable in polynomial time. It is based on finding all
subsets of fundamental cycles which takes about $\mathcal{O}(2^(|E|-|V|+1))$
time where $E$ represents a set of relationships (edges) and $V$ represents a
set of nodes (vertices) of the given graph.

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">
You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).
</Callout>

### `get()`

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `cycle_id: integer` ➡ Incremental cycle ID of a certain node. There is no guarantee on
  how nodes are going to be ordered within cycle. The cycle can be represented
  with a minimum of one ID, where it stands for self-loop.
* `node: Vertex` ➡ Vertex object with all properties which is going to be related to the cycle ID it belongs to.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}
```cypher
CALL cycles.get()
YIELD cycle_id, node;
```

## Example

<Steps>

{<h3> Database state </h3>} 

The database contains the following data: 

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/cycles/cycles-1.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
MERGE (a:Node {id: 0}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 1}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 0}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 1}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 2}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 3}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 2}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 4}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 4}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
```

{<h3> Identify cycles </h3>} 

Get the values using the following query:

```cypher
CALL cycles.get()
YIELD cycle_id, node
RETURN cycle_id, node;
```

Results: 

```plaintext
+-----------------+-----------------+
| cycle_id        | node            |
+-----------------+-----------------+
| 0               | (:Node {id: 2}) |
| 0               | (:Node {id: 0}) |
| 0               | (:Node {id: 1}) |
| 1               | (:Node {id: 4}) |
| 1               | (:Node {id: 2}) |
| 1               | (:Node {id: 3}) |
+-----------------+-----------------+
