### `categorize(original_prop_key, rel_type, is_outgoing, new_label, new_prop_name_key, copy_props_list)`

Generates a new category of nodes based on a specific property key from the existing nodes in the graph. Then, it creates relationships between the original and new category nodes to organize a graph based on these categories.

#### Input:

- `original_prop_key: string` ➡  the property key on the existing nodes used to determine the category.
- `rel_type: string` ➡ the type of relationship to be created between the original nodes and the new category nodes.
- `is_outgoing: bool` ➡ determines the direction of the new relationships. If 'true', relationships will be created from the original node to the category node. If 'false', they'll be created from the category node to the original node.
- `new_label: string` ➡ the label to be assigned to the new category nodes.
- `new_prop_name_key: string` ➡ the key for the new category node's property whose value will be the same as `original_prop_key` value.
- `copy_props_list: List[string] (default = [])` ➡ an array of property keys from the original nodes to be copied to the new category nodes.


#### Output:

- `status: string` ➡ "success" if no errors were generated.

#### Usage:

```cypher
CALL refactor.categorize('genre', 'GENRE', false, "Genre", "name") YIELD status RETURN status;
```

```plaintext
+----------------------------+
| status                     |
+----------------------------+
| success                    |
+----------------------------+
```

#### Example:

You can create a simple graph database by running the following queries:

```cypher
CREATE (a:Movie {id: 0, name: "MovieName", genre: "Drama"})
CREATE (b:Book {id: 1, name: "BookName1", genre: "Drama", propertyToCopy: "copy me"})
CREATE (c:Book {id: 2, name: "BookName2", genre: "Romance"});
```

The image below shows the above data as a graph:

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor/categorize1.png)

```cypher
CALL refactor.categorize('genre', 'GENRE', true, "Genre", "name", ["propertyToCopy"]) 
YIELD status RETURN status;
```

The results should be identical to the ones in the graph below, except for the
`id` values, which depend on the internal database `id` values:

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor/categorize2.png)

### `clone_nodes(nodes, clone_rels, skip_props)`

Clones specific nodes in the graph, preserving their original labels, properties and optionally relationships. Offers the flexibility to exclude specific node properties during the cloning process.

#### Input:

- `nodes: List[Node]` ➡  a list of nodes intended for duplication.
- `clone_rels: bool (default = false)` ➡  if set to true, the function will also clone the relationships of the original nodes, connecting them to the cloned nodes in the same manner.
- `skip_props: List[string] (default = [])` ➡  a list of property keys, properties associated with these keys will be skipped during the cloning process.


#### Output:

- `cloned_node_id: int` ➡ ID of the original node which was cloned.
- `new_node: Node` ➡ new cloned node.

#### Usage:

```cypher
MATCH (a:Person {name: "Ana", age: 22, id:0})
CALL refactor.clone_nodes([a], False, ["age", "id"]) 
YIELD cloned_node_id, new_node RETURN cloned_node_id, new_node;
```

```plaintext
+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| cloned_node_id             | new_node                   |
+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| 0                          | {                          |
|                            |     "id": 1,               |
|                            |     "labels": [            |
|                            |        "Person"            |
|                            |     ],                     |
|                            |     "properties": {        |
|                            |        name: "Ana"         |
|                            |     },                     |
|                            |     "type": "node"         |
|                            | }                          |
+----------------------------+----------------------------+
```

#### Example:

You can create a simple graph database by running the following queries:

```cypher
CREATE (a:Ana {name: "Ana", age: 22}) 
CREATE (b:Marija {name: "Marija", age: 20}) 
CREATE (a)-[r:KNOWS]->(b);
```

The image below shows the above data as a graph:

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor/clonenodes1.png)

```cypher
MATCH (a:Ana) MATCH (b:Marija)
CALL refactor.clone_nodes([a, b], True, ["age"]) YIELD * RETURN *;
```

The results should be identical to the ones in the graph below, except for the
`id` values, which depend on the internal database `id` values:

### `clone_subgraph(nodes, rels, config)`

Clones the subgraph by cloning the given list of nodes and relationships. If no relationships are provided, all existing relationships between the given nodes will be cloned.

#### Input:

- `nodes: List[Node]` ➡  a list of nodes which form the subgraph intended for duplication.
- `rels: List[Relationship] (default = [])` ➡  a list of relationships intended for duplication. If this list is empty or not provided, all existing relationships between the given nodes will be cloned.
- `config: Map (default = {})` ➡  configuration parameters explained below.

#### Parameters:

 | Name 	            | Type  | Default	| Description 	                                                |
 |-	                  |-	    |-	      |-	                                                            |
 | skipProperties     | List  | [ ]	    | A list of property keys. Properties associated with these keys will be skipped during the cloning process. Therefore, new nodes will not have them.|
 | standinNodes       | List	| [ ]  	  | A list of pairs (lists with only two elements) where: 1) The first element is the original node (from the input nodes list) that you're planning to clone. 2) The second element is an existing node in the graph that will "stand in" or replace the clone of the original node in the resultant subgraph.	|


#### Output:

- `cloned_node_id: int` ➡ ID of the original node which was cloned.
- `new_node: Node` ➡ new cloned node.

#### Usage:

```cypher
MATCH (ana:Ana {id: 0}), (marija:Marija {id: 1})
MATCH (ana)-[r1:KNOWS]->(marija)
CALL refactor.clone_subgraph([ana, marija], [r1], {standinNodes: [[ana, marija]]})
YIELD cloned_node_id, new_node RETURN cloned_node_id, new_node;
```

```plaintext
+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| cloned_node_id             | new_node                   |
+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| 1                          | {                          |
|                            |     "id": 2,               |
|                            |     "labels": [            |   -> node :Ana was not cloned
|                            |        "Marija"            |      because :Marija is its
|                            |     ],                     |      "stand-in" node
|                            |     "properties": {},      |
|                            |     "type": "node"         |
|                            | }                          |
+----------------------------+----------------------------+
```

#### Example:

You can create a simple graph database by running the following queries:

```cypher
MERGE (ana:Ana{name:'Ana'}) 
MERGE (marija:Marija{name:'Marija'}) 
MERGE (p2:Person{name:'person2'}) 
MERGE (p3:Person{name:'person3'}) 
MERGE (p4:Person{name:'person4'}) 
MERGE (p5:Person{name:'person5'}) 
MERGE (p6:Person{name:'person6'}) 
CREATE (ana)-[:KNOWS]->(p2)-[:KNOWS]->(p3)-[:KNOWS]->(p4) 
CREATE (p4)<-[:KNOWS]-(p5) 
CREATE (marija)-[:KNOWS]->(p6);
```

The image below shows the above data as a graph:

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor/clonesubgraph1.png)
    
```cypher
MATCH (ana:Ana),
      (p2:Person{name: "person2"}),     
      (p3:Person{name: "person3"}),
      (p4:Person{name: "person4"}),
      (p5:Person{name: "person5"})
CALL refactor.clone_subgraph([ana, p2, p3, p4, p5], [], {
       standinNodes:[[ana, marija]]
   })
YIELD * RETURN *;
```

The results should be identical to the ones in the graph below, except for the
`id` values, which depend on the internal database `id` values. Note that the 
whole subgraph was cloned except for node `:Ana` because node `:Marija` was 
used as its "stand-in" node.

- `config: Map (default = {})` ➡  configuration parameters explained below.

#### Parameters:

 | Name 	            | Type  | Default	| Description 	                                                |
 |-	                  |-	    |-	      |-	                                                            |
 | skipProperties     | List  | [ ]	    | A list of property keys. Properties associated with these keys will be skipped during the cloning process. Therefore, new nodes will not have them.|
 | standinNodes       | List	| [ ]  	  | A list of pairs (lists with only two elements) where the first element is the original node (from the input nodes list) that you're planning to clone, and the second element is an existing node in the graph that will "stand-in" or replace the clone of the original node in the resultant subgraph.	|

#### Output:

- `cloned_node_id: int` ➡ ID of the original node which was cloned.
- `new_node: Node` ➡ new cloned node.

#### Usage:

```cypher
MATCH (ana:Ana {id: 0}), (marija:Marija {id: 1})
MATCH path = (ana)-[:KNOWS*]->(marija)
CALL refactor.clone_subgraph_from_paths([path], {standinNodes:[[ana, marija]]})
YIELD cloned_node_id, new_node RETURN cloned_node_id, new_node;
```

|                            |        "Marija"            |      because :Marija is its
|                            |     ],                     |      "stand-in" node
|                            |     "properties": {},      |

MERGE (p3:Person{name:'person3'}) 
MERGE (p4:Person{name:'person4'}) 
MERGE (p5:Person{name:'person5'}) 
MERGE (p6:Person{name:'person6'}) 
CREATE (ana)-[:KNOWS]->(p2)-[:KNOWS]->(p3)-[:KNOWS]->(p4) 
CREATE (p4)<-[:KNOWS]-(p5) CREATE (p5)-[:LOVES]->(p6) 
CREATE (marija)-[:KNOWS]->(p6);
```

The image below shows the above data as a graph:

### `collapse_node(nodes, type)`

Collapses a node into a relationship. Can only collapse nodes with exactly 1 in relationship, and exactly 1 out relationship. The node must not have any self relationships. Collapsing any node that doesn't satisfy these requirements results in an exception.

#### Input:

- `nodes: Any` ➡  a node, node ID, or list of nodes and node IDs.
- `type: string` ➡ the type of the new relationship.

#### Output:

- `id_collapsed: integer` ➡ ID of the collapsed node.
- `new_relationship: integer` ➡ newly created relationship.

#### Usage:

Create the following graph: 

```cypher
CREATE (c:Car)-[t:DRIVES_ON]->(r:Road)-[l:LEADS_TO]->(ci:City);
```

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor/graph_before.png)

Run the `refactor.collapse_node()` procedure:

```cypher
MATCH (r:Road)
CALL refactor.collapse_node(r, "DRIVES_TO") YIELD id_collapsed, new_relationship RETURN id_collapsed, new_relationship;
```

```plaintext
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

#### Output:

- `id_inverted: integer` ➡ ID of the inverted relationship.
- `relationship` ➡ the inverted relationship.

#### Usage:

Create the following graph:

```cypher
CREATE (d:Dog)-[l:LOVES]->(h:Human);
```

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor/real_before.png)

Run the `refactor.invert()` procedure:

```cypher
MATCH (d:Dog)-[l:LOVES]->(h:Human)
CALL refactor.invert(l) YIELD id_inverted, relationship RETURN id_inverted, relationship;
```

```plaintext
