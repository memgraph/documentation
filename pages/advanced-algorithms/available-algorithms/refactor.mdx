## Procedures

<Callout type="info">
You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).
</Callout>

### `from()`

Redirect the relationship to use a new start (from) node.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `relationship: Relationship` ➡ Relationship that needs to be modified.
- `new_from: Node` ➡ THe new start (from) node.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `relationship` - The modified relationship.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

The database contains the following data:

```cypher
MERGE (ivan:Person {name: "Ivan"}) MERGE (matija:Person {name: "Matija"}) MERGE (diora:Person {name:"Idora"}) CREATE (ivan)-[:Friends]->(matija);
```

The following query changes the the relationship `Ivan ➡ Matija` to `Idora ➡ Matija`:

```cypher
MATCH (:Person {name: "Ivan"})-[rel:Friends]->(:Person {name: "Matija"}) MATCH (idora: Person {name:"Idora"}) CALL refactor.from(rel, idora) YIELD relationship RETURN relationship;
```

### `to()`

Redirect the relationship to use a new end (to) node.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `relationship: Relationship` ➡ Relationship that needs to be modified.
- `new_to: Node` ➡ The new end (to) node.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `relationship` - The modified relationship.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

The database contains the following data:

```cypher
MERGE (ivan:Person {name: "Ivan"}) MERGE (matija:Person {name: "Matija"})
MERGE (diora:Person {name:"Idora"}) CREATE (ivan)-[:Friends]->(matija);
```

The following query changes the the relationship `Ivan ➡ Matija` to `Ivan ➡ Idora`:

```cypher
MATCH (:Person {name: "Ivan"})-[rel:Friends]->(:Person {name: "Matija"})
MATCH (idora: Person {name:"Idora"}) CALL refactor.to(rel, idora)
YIELD relationship
RETURN relationship;
```

### `rename_label()`

Rename a label from `old_label` to `new_label` for all nodes. If `nodes` is
provided renaming is applied only to the given nodes. If a node doesn't contain
the `old_label` the procedure doesn't modify it.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

The database contains the following data:

```cypher
CREATE (:Node1 {title: "Node1"})
CREATE (:Node2 {title: "Node2"})
CREATE (:Node1);
```

The following query changes the label of the first node to `Node`:

```cypher
MATCH (n) 
WITH collect(n) AS nodes 
CALL refactor.rename_label("Node1", "Node3", nodes)
YIELD nodes_changed
RETURN nodes_changed;
```

|    2                       |
+----------------------------+
```

### `rename_node_property()`

Rename a property from `old_property` to `new_property` for all nodes. If
`nodes` is provided renaming is applied only to the given nodes. If a node
doesn't contain the `old_property` the procedure doesn't modify it.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `old_property: str` ➡ The old property name.
- `new_label: str` ➡ The new property name.
- `nodes: List[Node]` ➡ The list of nodes to be modified.

```

The following query will modify `Node1` and `Node4`:

```cypher
MATCH (n)
WITH collect(n) AS nodes
CALL refactor.rename_node_property("title", "description", nodes)
YIELD nodes_changed
RETURN nodes_changed;
```

Result: 

```plaintext

+----------------------------+
|    2                       |
+----------------------------+
```

### `categorize()`

Generates a new category of nodes based on a specific property key from the
existing nodes in the graph. Then, it creates relationships between the original
and new category nodes to organize a graph based on these categories.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `original_prop_key: string` ➡ The property key on the existing nodes used to
  determine the category.
- `rel_type: string` ➡ The type of relationship to be created between the
  original nodes and the new category nodes.
- `is_outgoing: bool` ➡ Determines the direction of the new relationships. If
  `true`, relationships will be created from the original node to the category
  node. If `false`, they'll be created from the category node to the original
  node.
- `new_label: string` ➡ The label to be assigned to the new category nodes.
- `new_prop_name_key: string` ➡ The key for the new category node's property
  whose value will be the same as `original_prop_key` value.
- `copy_props_list: List[string] (default = [])` ➡ An array of property keys
  from the original nodes to be copied to the new category nodes.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `status: string` ➡ Returns `success` if no errors were generated.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

```cypher
CALL refactor.categorize('genre', 'GENRE', false, "Genre", "name")
YIELD status
RETURN status;
```

Results:

```plaintext
+----------------------------+
| status                     |
+----------------------------+
| success                    |
+----------------------------+
```

{<h4> Example: </h4>}

The database contains the following data:

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor/categorize1.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
CREATE (a:Movie {id: 0, name: "MovieName", genre: "Drama"})
CREATE (b:Book {id: 1, name: "BookName1", genre: "Drama", propertyToCopy: "copy me"})
CREATE (c:Book {id: 2, name: "BookName2", genre: "Romance"});
```

Categorize the graph:

```cypher
CALL refactor.categorize('genre', 'GENRE', true, "Genre", "name", ["propertyToCopy"])
YIELD status
RETURN status;
```

The graph now looks like this:

- `nodes: List[Node]` ➡  A list of nodes intended for duplication.
- `withRelationships: bool (default = false)` ➡  If set to `true`, the function
  will also clone the relationships of the original nodes, connecting them to
  the cloned nodes in the same manner.
- `skipProperties: List[string] (default = [])` ➡  A list of property keys,
  properties associated with these keys will be skipped during the cloning
  process.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

### `normalize_as_boolean()`

The procedure normalizes properties to `true` or `false` depending on whether
the property value is contained in `true_values` or `false_values`. If the
property value is not contained in either list, the property is removed. Throws
an exception if both lists contain the same value.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `entity: Node|Relationship` ➡  The node or relationship on which the property value will be normalized.
- `property_key: string` ➡  The key of the property to be normalized.
- `true_values: List[Any]` ➡  A list of property values that will be normalized to `true`.
- `false_values: List[Any]` ➡  A list of property values that will be normalized to `false`.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Create a graph using the queries below:

```cypher
CREATE (n1:Node1 {property: "YES"})
CREATE (n2:Node2 {property: "NO"})
CREATE (n3:Node3 {property: "MAYBE", exists:true})
CREATE (n4:Node4)
CREATE (n5:Node5 {exists:false})
CREATE (n1)-[:Rel1 {property:"YES"}]->(n2)
CREATE (n2)-[:Rel2 {property:"NO"}]->(n3)
CREATE (n3)-[:Rel3]->(n4)
CREATE (n4)-[:Rel4 {property:"MAYBE", exists:"YES"}]->(n5);
```

The following query will set  every property called `property` to `true` if it
is equal to `YES`, and to `false` if it is equal to `NO`, otherwise it will
delete the property:

```cypher
MATCH (n)
WITH collect(n) AS nodes
CALL refactor.normalize_as_boolean(nodes, 'property', ['YES'], ['NO']);
```

### `extract_node()`

The procedure creates a node from the given relationship (and deletes the
relationship) with the given labels and connects the new node to the start and
end node of the given relationship with the given types.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `relationships: Relationship|int|List[Relationship|int]` ➡ Relationships to be changed into a node defined by their ID, themselves, or a list of any of those two.
- `labels: List[string]` ➡ A list of labels that should assigned to the newly created node.
- `outType: String` ➡ The type of the outgoing relationship from the newly created node.
- `inType: String` ➡ The type of the incoming relationship to the newly created node.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `input: integer` ➡ The ID of the provided, now deleted relationship.
- `output: Node` ➡ The newly created node.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Create a graph using the query below:

```cypher
CREATE (Node1:Label {name: 'Node1'})
CREATE (Node2:Label {name: 'Node2'})
CREATE (Node3:Label {name: 'Node3'})
CREATE (Node4:Label {name: 'Node4'})
CREATE (Node5:Label {name: 'Node5'})
CREATE (Node1)-[:Rel1]->(Node2)
CREATE (Node2)-[:Rel2]->(Node3)
CREATE (Node3)-[:Rel3]->(Node4)
CREATE (Node4)-[:Rel4]->(Node5);
```

The query will delete all the relationships in the graph, create them as nodes
with the label `NewLabel` and connect them to the nodes they connected as a
relationship:

```cypher
MATCH ()-[rel]->()
CALL refactor.extract_node(rel, ["NewLabel"], "OutRelationship", "InRelationship")
YIELD output
RETURN output;
```

### `delete_and_reconnect()`

The procedure deletes the given nodes from the given path (deleting them in the
graph) and reconnects the remaining nodes.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `path: Path` ➡  The given path.
- `nodes: List[Node]` ➡ A list of nodes to be deleted.
- `config: Map` ➡ Config for reconnecting nodes.
      - `relationshipSelectionStrategy: string (default = "incoming")`:
            - `"incoming"` - Relationship with the lower index in the path will be used for reconnection.
            - `"outgoing"` - The relationship with the higher index in the path will be used for reconnection.
            - `"merge"` - The relationships will be merged, and the relationship type will be changed to "type2_type1" where type1 is the type of the relationship with the lower index in the path. If both relationships have the same property the property in the reconnected relationship will be decided by `properties` in the config.
      - `properties: string (default = "combine")`:
            - `"discard"` - The property of the relationship with the lower index in the path wins.
            - `"overwrite"` / "override" - The property of the relationship with the higher index in the path wins.
            - `"combine"` - Merges properties by creating a list in which both property values are contained.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `nodes: List[Node]` ➡ Nodes which were not deleted from the graph.
- `relationships: List[Relationship]` ➡ Relationships which were not deleted from the graph.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

All the usage examples show how the procedure operates using the following graph:

```cypher
CREATE (n1:Node {name: "Node 1"})-[:Rel1 {name: "Rel1"}]->(n2:Node {name: "Node 2"})-[:Rel2 {name: "Rel2"}]->(n3:Node {name: "Node 3"})-[:Rel3 {name: "Rel3"}]->(n4:Node {name: "Node 4"})-[:Rel4 {name: "Rel4"}]->(n5:Node {name: "Node 5"});
```

Use the relationships with the lower index in the path to reconnect the nodes:

```cypher
MATCH p=(a:Node)-->(b:Node)-->(c:Node)-->(d:Node)-->(e:Node)
WITH p, [b,d] as l CALL refactor.delete_and_reconnect(p, l, {relationshipSelectionStrategy: 'incoming'})
YIELD nodes, relationships
RETURN nodes, relationships;
```

Result:

```plaintext
nodes: [{"id": 5, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 1"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 7, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 3"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 9, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 5"}, "type": "node"}]
relationships: [{"id": 4, "start": 5, "end": 7, "label": "Rel1", "properties": {"name": "Rel1"}, "type": "relationship"}, {"id": 6, "start": 7, "end": 9, "label": "Rel3", "properties": {"name": "Rel3"}, "type": "relationship"}]
```

Use the relationships with the higher index in the path to reconnect the nodes:

```cypher
MATCH p=(a:Node)-->(b:Node)-->(c:Node)-->(d:Node)-->(e:Node)
WITH p, [b,d] as l CALL refactor.delete_and_reconnect(p, l, {relationshipSelectionStrategy: 'outgoing'})
YIELD nodes, relationships
RETURN nodes, relationships;
```

Result:

```plaintext
nodes: [{"id": 15, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 1"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 17, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 3"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 19, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 5"}, "type": "node"}]
relationships: [{"id": 13, "start": 15, "end": 17, "label": "Rel2", "properties": {"name": "Rel2"}, "type": "relationship"}, {"id": 15, "start": 17, "end": 19, "label": "Rel4", "properties": {"name": "Rel4"}, "type": "relationship"}]
```

The relationship used for reconnecting will have properties of both relationships but in case of a conflict (properties with the same key) the property from the relationship with the smaller index in the path will prevail:

```cypher
MATCH p=(a:Node)-->(b:Node)-->(c:Node)-->(d:Node)-->(e:Node)
WITH p, [b,d] as l CALL refactor.delete_and_reconnect(p, l, {relationshipSelectionStrategy: 'merge', properties: 'discard'})
YIELD nodes, relationships
RETURN nodes, relationships;
```

Result:

```plaintext
nodes: [{"id": 20, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 1"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 22, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 3"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 24, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 5"}, "type": "node"}]
relationships: [{"id": 16, "start": 20, "end": 22, "label": "Rel2_Rel1", "properties": {"name": "Rel1"}, "type": "relationship"}, {"id": 18, "start": 22, "end": 24, "label": "Rel4_Rel3", "properties": {"name": "Rel3"}, "type": "relationship"}]
```

The relationship used for reconnecting will have properties of both relationships but in case of a conflict (properties with the same key) the property from the relationship with the higher index in the path will prevail:

```cypher
MATCH p=(a:Node)-->(b:Node)-->(c:Node)-->(d:Node)-->(e:Node)
WITH p, [b,d] as l CALL refactor.delete_and_reconnect(p, l, {relationshipSelectionStrategy: 'merge', properties: 'override'})
YIELD nodes, relationships
RETURN nodes, relationships;
```

Result:

```plaintext
nodes: [{"id": 25, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 1"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 27, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 3"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 29, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 5"}, "type": "node"}]
relationships: [{"id": 21, "start": 25, "end": 27, "label": "Rel2_Rel1", "properties": {"name": "Rel2"}, "type": "relationship"}, {"id": 23, "start": 27, "end": 29, "label": "Rel4_Rel3", "properties": {"name": "Rel4"}, "type": "relationship"}]
```

The relationship used for reconnecting will have properties of both relationships but in case of a conflict (properties with the same key) the new property will be a list containing both properties:


```cypher
MATCH p=(a:Node)-->(b:Node)-->(c:Node)-->(d:Node)-->(e:Node)
WITH p, [b,d] as l CALL refactor.delete_and_reconnect(p, l, {relationshipSelectionStrategy: 'merge', properties: 'combine'})
YIELD nodes, relationships
RETURN nodes, relationships;
```

Result:

```plaintext
nodes: [{"id": 35, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 1"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 37, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 3"}, "type": "node"}, {"id": 39, "labels": ["Node"], "properties": {"name": "Node 5"}, "type": "node"}]
relationships: [{"id": 28, "start": 35, "end": 37, "label": "Rel2_Rel1", "properties": {"name": ["Rel1", "Rel2"]}, "type": "relationship"}, {"id": 30, "start": 37, "end": 39, "label": "Rel4_Rel3", "properties": {"name": ["Rel3", "Rel4"]}, "type": "relationship"}]
```

### `rename_type()`

The procedure changes the relationship type.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `oldType: string` ➡  The relationship type that will be renamed.
- `newType: string` ➡  The new relationship type.
- `rels: List[Relationship]` ➡  The list of relationships whose types will be renamed.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `relationships_changed: integer` ➡ The number of relationships with a changed property name.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Create a graph using the queries below:

```cypher
CREATE (h:Human {name:"Carl"})-[r1:RUNS {distance_in_km:20}]->(d:Destination),
(h1:Human {name:"Marta"})-[r2:RUNS {distance_in_km: 20}]->(d),
(h2:Human {name:"Peter"})-[r3:RUNS {distance_in_km: 40}]->(d);
```

Use the procedure to change the type `RUNS` to `SPRINTS` in all relationships:

```cypher
MATCH ()-[r]-()
WITH COLLECT(distinct(r)) AS rels
CALL refactor.rename_type("RUNS", "SPRINTS", rels) YIELD relationships_changed RETURN relationships_changed;
```

The procedure returns the number of updated relationships:

```plaintext
+---------------------------------------+
| relationships_changed                 |
+---------------------------------------+
| 3                                     |
+---------------------------------------+
```

### `rename_type_property()`

Renames the property of a relationship.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `old_property: string` ➡  The relationship property that will be renamed.
- `new_property: string` ➡  The new property name.
- `rels: List[Relationship]` ➡  The list of relationships whose properties will be renamed.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `relationships_changed: integer` ➡ The number of relationships with a changed property name.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Create a graph using the queries below:

```cypher
CREATE (h:Human {name:"Carl"})-[r1:RUNS {distance_in_km:20}]->(d:Destination),
(h1:Human {name:"Marta"})-[r2:RUNS {distance_in_km: 20}]->(d),
(h2:Human {name:"Peter"})-[r3:RUNS {distance_in_km: 40}]->(d);
```

The graph schema is as follows:

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor/rename_prop_before.png)

Use the procedure to change the name of `distance_in_km` property of all relationships into `distance`:

```cypher
MATCH ()-[r]-()
WITH COLLECT(distinct(r)) AS rels
CALL refactor.rename_type_property("distance_in_km", "distance", rels)
YIELD relationships_changed
RETURN relationships_changed;
```
The procedure returns the number of updated relationships:

```plaintext
+---------------------------------------+
| relationships_changed                 |
+---------------------------------------+
| 3                                     |
+---------------------------------------+
```

The graph schema after the update is as follows:

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/refactor/rename_prop_after.png)

The following query will change the name of `distance_in_km` property in a specific relationship, in this case, relationship going from the `Human` node with the `name` property `Carl`:

```cypher
MATCH (h:Human {name:"Carl"})-[r]-()
CALL refactor.rename_type_property("distance_in_km","distance",[r]) YIELD relationships_changed RETURN relationships_changed;
```

```plaintext
+---------------------------------------+
| relationships_changed                 |
+---------------------------------------+
| 1                                     |
+---------------------------------------+
```
