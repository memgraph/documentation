# tsp

TSP or "Travelling salesman problem" is one of the well-known problems in graph
theory. The goal of the problem is to find the shortest route that visits each
node once, starting and finishing from the same node, given the distance between
each one of them. It is an NP-hard problem in optimization and therefore there
exists no exact solution. Here implemented are trivial, *greedy* and *k-approx*
methods that find the solution within a *k-bound* of the optimal one. That means
that solution is not going to be more than *k* times worse than the best
possible. The algorithm uses the distance calculator to determine the distance
between points, and works only with geographical locations, meaning each node
needs to have its *lat* and *lng* property.

```cypher
(location:Location {lat: 44.1194, lng: 15.2314})
```

Too slow?

If this algorithm implementation is too slow for your use case, open an issue on
[Memgraph's GitHub repository](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/issues) and
request a rewrite to C++!

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">

You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of
the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).

</Callout>

### `solve()`

Use the procedure to solve the travelling salesman problem.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `points: List[Vertex]` ➡ List of points to calculate TSP on. Required to have *lng* and *lat* properties.
- `method: string (default=1.5_approx)` ➡ Method used for optimization. Can be either ***1.5_approx***, ***2_approx*** or ***greedy***.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `sources: List[Vertex]` ➡ List of elements from 1st to (n-1)-th element.
- `destinations: List[Vertex]` ➡ List of elements from 2nd to n-th element
The pairs of them represent individual edges between 2 nodes in the graph.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To solve the travelling salesman problem, use the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Location)
WITH COLLECT(n) as locations
CALL tsp_module.solve(points) YIELD sources, destinations;
```

## Example

<Steps>

{<h3> Database state </h3>} 

The database contains the following data: 

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/tsp/tsp-1.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
CREATE (location:Location {name: 'Zagreb', lat: 45.8150, lng: 15.9819});
CREATE (location:Location {name: 'Split', lat: 43.5081, lng: 16.4402});
CREATE (location:Location {name: 'Rijeka', lat: 45.3271, lng:  14.4422});
CREATE (location:Location {name: 'Osijek', lat: 45.5550, lng: 18.6955});
CREATE (location:Location {name: 'Zadar', lat: 44.1194, lng: 15.2314});
```

{<h3> Solve the problem </h3>} 

Use the following query to solve the travelling salesman problem:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Location)
WITH COLLECT(n) AS locations
CALL tsp.solve(locations, "1.5_approx") YIELD sources, destinations
WITH EXTRACT(i IN RANGE(0, SIZE(sources) - 1) | [sources[i], destinations[i]]) AS path
UNWIND path as edge
WITH edge[0] AS from, edge[1] AS to
CREATE (from)-[path:PATH]->(to)
RETURN from, to, path;
```

Result:
