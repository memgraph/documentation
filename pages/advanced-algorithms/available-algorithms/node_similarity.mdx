# node_similarity

If you want to find out how similar two nodes in a graph are, you need to get a
numerical value that represents the <em>node similarity</em> between those two
nodes. There are many node similarity measures and currently this module
contains the following: 
* Jaccard similarity 
* overlap similarity
* cosine similarity

**The Jaccard similarity** is computed using the following formula:

$$ Jaccard(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) = \frac{|\mathcal{A} \cap \mathcal{B}|}{|\mathcal{A}| + |\mathcal{B}| - |\mathcal{A} \cap \mathcal{B}|} $$

**The overlap similarity** is computed using the following formula:

$$ Overlap(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) = \frac{|\mathcal{A} \cap \mathcal{B}|}{\min(|\mathcal{A}|, |\mathcal{B}|)} $$

**The cosine similarity** computes similarity between two nodes based on some
property. This property should be a vector and it can be computed using the
following formula:

$$ \text{Cosine}(A, B, \text{property}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A[\text{property}_i] \times B[\text{property}_i]}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A[\text{property}_i]^2} \times \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} B[\text{property}_i]^2}} $$

Set A represents all outgoing neighbors of one node, set B represents all
outgoing neighbors of the other node. In all the given formulas, the numerator
is the cardinality of the intersection of set A and set B (in other words, the
cardinality of the common neighbors set). The denominator differs but requires
the cardinality of sets A and B in some way.

For each similarity measure, there are two functions, one that calculates
similarity between all pairs of nodes and the other, pairwise function, that
takes into account pairwise similarities between two set of nodes.
