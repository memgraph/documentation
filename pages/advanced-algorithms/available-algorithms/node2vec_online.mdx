# node2vec_online (Enterprise)

<Callout type="info">
From Memgraph 3.0, dynamic graph algorithms became a part of the Memgraph Enterprise license. 
To use dynamic graph algorithms, you need to [enable Memgraph Enterprise license](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).

The **node2vec_online** algorithm learns and updates temporal node embeddings on
the fly for tracking and measuring node similarity over time in graph streams.
The algorithm creates similar embeddings for two nodes (e.g. `v` and `u`) if there
is an option to reach one node from the other across edges that appeared
recently. In other words, the embedding of a node `v` should be more similar to
the embedding of node `u` if we can reach `u` by taking steps backward to node
`v` across edges that appeared before the previous one. These steps backward
from one node to the other form a temporal walk. It is temporal since it depends
on when the edge appeared in the graph.

To make two nodes more similar and to create these temporal walks, the `Node2Vec Online` algorithm uses the `StreamWalk updater` and `Word2Vec learner`.

`StreamWalk updater` is a machine for sampling temporal walks. A sampling of the
walk is done in a backward fashion because we look only at the incoming edges of
the node. Since one node can have multiple incoming edges, when sampling a walk,
`StreamWalk updater` uses probabilities to determine which incoming edge of the
node it will take next, and that way leading to a new node. These probabilities
are computed after the edge arrives and before temporal walk sampling.
Probability represents a sum over all temporal walks `z` ending in node `v`
using edges arriving no later than the latest one of already sampled ones in the
temporal walk. When the algorithm decides which edge to take next for temporal
walk creation, it uses these computed weights (probabilities). Every time a new
edge appears in the graph, these probabilities are updated just for two nodes of
a new edge.

After walks sampling, `Word2Vec learner` uses these prepared temporal walks to
make node embeddings more similar using the `gensim Word2Vec` module. These
sampled walks are given as sentences to the `gensim Word2Vec` module, which then
optimizes for the similarity of the node embeddings in the walk with stochastic
gradient descent using a skip-gram model or continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW).

Embeddings capture the graph topology, relationships between nodes, and further
relevant information. How the embeddings capture this inherent information of
the graph is not fixed.

Capturing information in networks often shuttles between two kinds of
similarities: **homophily** and **structural equivalence**. Under the
**homophily** hypothesis, nodes that are highly interconnected and belong to
similar network clusters or communities should be embedded closely together. In
contrast, under the **structural equivalence** hypothesis, nodes that have
similar structural roles in networks should be embedded closely together (e.g.,
nodes that act as hubs of their corresponding communities).

Currently, our implementation captures for **homophily** - nodes that are highly
interconnected and belong to similar network clusters or communities.

## Procedures

The basic node classification workflow is as follows:

1. Load data to Memgraph.
2. Set updater parameters by calling the `set_streamwalk_updater()` procedure. 
3. Set learner parameters by calling the `set_streamwalk_learner()` procedure. 
3. Call the `update()` procedure to set the node embeddings.
4. Inspect the results by calling the `get()` procedures.
5. If you want to reset the parameters and start again, call the `restart()` procedure.

<Callout type="info">
You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).
</Callout>

### `set_streamwalk_updater()`

Use the procedure to sample the temporal random walks in the graph. Once the
`set_word2vec_learner()` parameters are set, you first need to call the
`reset()` procedure to update the parameters.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.

- `half_life: integer` ➡ Half-life [seconds], used in the temporal walk probability
  calculation.
- `max_length: integer` ➡ The maximum length of the sampled temporal random walks.
- `beta: float` ➡ The damping factor for long paths.
- `cutoff: integer` ➡ A temporal cutoff in seconds to exclude very distant past.
- `sampled_walks: integer` ➡ The number of sampled walks for each edge update.
- `full_walks: boolean` ➡  An option to return every node of the sampled walk
for representation learning (`full_walks=True`) or only the endpoints of the
walk (`full_walks=False`).

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Output: </h4>}

- `message: string` ➡ Whether parameters are set or they need to be reset.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

To start sampling the temporal random walks, use the following query:

```cypher
CALL node2vec_online.set_streamwalk_updater(7200, 3, 0.9, 604800, 4, False) 
YIELD message 
RETURN message;
```

### `set_word2vec_learner()`

Use the procedure to calculate embeddings. To recalculate embeddings with
different parameters, you first need to call the `reset()` procedure to update
the parameters.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.

- `embedding_dimension: integer` ➡ The number of dimensions in the representation of the
  embedding vector.
- `learning_rate: float` ➡ The learning rate.
- `skip_gram: boolean (default=True)` ➡ Whether to use skip-gram model (`True`) or
  continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW) (`False`).
- `negative_rate: integer` ➡ Negative rate for Gensim Word2Vec model.
- `threads: integer` ➡ Maximum number of threads for parallelization.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Output: </h4>}

- `message: string` ➡ Whether parameters are set or they need to be reset.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

To set the learner parameter values, use the following query:

```cypher
CALL node2vec_online.set_word2vec_learner(128, 0.01, True, 10, 1)
YIELD message
RETURN message;
```

### `update()`

Use the `udpate()` procedure to (re)calculate embeddings.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.

- `edges: mgp.List[mgp.Edge]` ➡  A list of relationships added to the graph.
  Embeddings will be (re)calculated only for the starting and ending nodes of those
  new relationships. 

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

You can use the `update()` procedure in two ways.

You can create a trigger, so every time a relationships is added to graph, the
trigger calls a procedure and makes an update:

```cypher
CREATE TRIGGER trigger ON --> CREATE BEFORE COMMIT
EXECUTE CALL node2vec_online.update(createdEdges)
RETURN *;
```

Or, you can filter out certain relationships and call the algorithm with those
relationships:

```cypher
MATCH (n)-[e]->(m)
WITH COLLECT(e) as edges
CALL node2vec_online.update(edges)
RETURN edges;
```

### `get()`

The `get()` procedure returns the node embeddings.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.


{<h4 className="custom-header"> Output: </h4>}

- `node: mgp.Vertex` ➡ The node in the graph for which embedding exists.
- `embedding: mgp.List[mgp.Number]` ➡ Embedding for the given node.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

To return the calculated node embeddings, use the following query: 

```cypher
CALL node2vec_online.get()
YIELD node, embedding
RETURN node, embedding;
```

### `reset()`

Use the procedure to reset the updater and learner parameters.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Output: </h4>}

* `message: string` ➡ Message that parameters are ready to be set again.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

To reset the parameters, use the following query: 

```cypher
CALL node2vec_online.reset()
YIELD message
RETURN message;
```

### `help()`

The procedure will return procedures available in the query module, their
parameters and descriptions. 

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Output: </h4>}

* `name: string` ➡ The name of available functions.
* `value: string` ➡ Documentation for every function.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

To get help, use the following query:

```cypher
CALL node2vec_online.help()
YIELD name, value RETURN name, value;
```
