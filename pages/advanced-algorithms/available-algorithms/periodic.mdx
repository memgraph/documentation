# periodic

The **periodic module** enables users to execute a query periodically in
batches. In this case, the name periodic doesn't indicate that the query is
executed after a time interval, but rather that, due to the complexity of the
query, the results of some input source are batched to speed up execution.

<Callout type="info">

If you enabled [authentication](/configuration/security#creating-users) in
Memgraph, set the following environment variables to be able to use the
procedures in the query module: 

- `MG_HOST`
- `MG_PORT`
- `MG_USERNAME`
- `MG_PASSWORD`

These environment variables are different from the [MEMGRAPH environment
variables](/configuration/configuration-settings#environment-variables) and need
to be set in addition to them. 

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">

As the results are batched and executed in different transactions, every
executed batch is committed by itself. If an issue occurs while running this
procedure, the already committed batches cannot be rolled back.

## Procedures

The procedure executes a query periodically in batches.

### `iterate()`

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `input_query: string` ➡ The input query which will yield the results that need to be batched.
- `running_query: string` ➡ The query which will be executed on the batched results:
- `config: Map[string, int]` ➡ Procedure parameters:
  - `batch_size: Integer` ➡ The value specifies the number of results in a batch.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `success: boolean` ➡ `true` if the procedure executed successfully as a whole, `false` otherwise.
- `number_of_executed_batches: Integer` ➡ The number of executed batches (possibly a fraction of the full number if the procedure returned `success: false`).

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To batch results, use the following query:

```cypher
CALL periodic.iterate(
  "LOAD CSV FROM '/tmp/file.csv' WITH HEADER AS row RETURN row.node_id AS node_id, row.supernode_id AS supernode_id", 
  "MATCH (s:SuperNode {supernode_id: supernode_id}), (n:Node {node_id: node_id}) CREATE (s)-[:HAS_REL_TO]->(n)", 
  {batch_size: 5000}) 
YIELD success, number_of_executed_batches
RETURN success, number_of_executed_batches;
```

### `delete()`

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `config: Map[string, int]` ➡ Procedure parameters:
  - `labels: List[string]` ➡ The value specifies the which node labels to search when deleting.
  - `edge_types: List[string]` ➡ The value specifies the which edge types to search when deleting.
  - `batch_size: integer` ➡ The value specifies the batch size used when deleting periodically.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `success: boolean` ➡ `true` if the procedure executed successfully as a whole, `false` otherwise.
- `number_of_executed_batches: Integer` ➡ The number of executed batches (possibly a fraction of the full number if the procedure returned `success: false`).
- `number_of_deleted_nodes: Integer` ➡ The number of deleted nodes during periodic delete.
- `number_of_deleted_relationships: Integer` ➡ The number of deleted relationships during periodic delete.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Batch size in every query is arbitrary. It is advised to be up to a million, but highly depends on the workload.
Please test the batch size according to your workload.

To batch delete only the nodes, and their corresponding edges, use the following query:

```cypher
CALL periodic.delete({batch_size: 100000, labels: ["MY_LABEL"]}) 
YIELD success, number_of_executed_batches, number_of_deleted_nodes, number_of_deleted_relationships
RETURN success, number_of_executed_batches, number_of_deleted_nodes, number_of_deleted_relationships;
```

To batch delete only the relationships, use the following query:

```cypher
CALL periodic.delete({batch_size: 100000, edge_types: ["MY_EDGE_TYPE"]}) 
YIELD success, number_of_executed_batches, number_of_deleted_nodes, number_of_deleted_relationships
RETURN success, number_of_executed_batches, number_of_deleted_nodes, number_of_deleted_relationships;
```

To batch delete everything, use the following query:

```cypher
CALL periodic.delete({batch_size: 100000}) 
YIELD success, number_of_executed_batches, number_of_deleted_nodes, number_of_deleted_relationships
RETURN success, number_of_executed_batches, number_of_deleted_nodes, number_of_deleted_relationships;
```
## Example

The example shows how to import relationships that create a supernode from a CSV
file.

<Steps>

{<h3> Create indexes </h3>} 

First, create indexes on all relevant labels and properties to speed up import.

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :SuperNode;
CREATE INDEX ON :SuperNode(supernode_id);
CREATE INDEX ON :Node;
CREATE INDEX ON :Node(node_id);
```

{<h3> Create nodes </h3>} 

At the end of the example, one node will be connected to the other million
nodes. The following query will create a million and one nodes.

```
CREATE (:SuperNode {supernode_id: 1});
FOREACH (i IN range(1, 1000000) | CREATE (:Node {id: i}));
```

{<h3> The CSV file </h3>} 

The CSV file contains the data needed to create the relationships, the ID of a
start node and the end node of a relationship:

```cypher
supernode_id,node_id
1,1
1,2
1,3
1,4
1,5
1,6
...
1,999998
1,999999
1,1000000
```

### `periodic.iterate()`

The procedure will execute the relationship creation between a supernode and all
the other nodes based on the CSV file in batches:

```cypher
CALL periodic.iterate(
  "LOAD CSV FROM '/tmp/file.csv' WITH HEADER AS row RETURN row.node_id AS node_id, row.supernode_id AS supernode_id",
  "MATCH (s:SuperNode {supernode_id: supernode_id}), (n:Node {node_id: node_id}) CREATE (s)-[:HAS_REL_TO]->(n)",
  {batch_size: 5000})
YIELD success, number_of_executed_batches
RETURN success, number_of_executed_batches;
```

Result: 

```plaintext
+------------------+----------------------------+
| success          | number_of_executed_batches |
+------------------+----------------------------+
| true             | 200                        |
+------------------+----------------------------+

```
</Steps>
