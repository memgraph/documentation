This module, named **nxalg**, provides a comprehensive set of thin wrappers
around most of the algorithms present in the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)
package. The wrapper functions have the capability to create a NetworkX
compatible graph-like object that can stream the native database graph directly
saving on memory usage significantly.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.

- `source: Vertex` ➡ Starting node for the path.
- `target: Vertex` ➡ Ending node for the path.
- `weight: string (default=NULL)` ➡ If `NULL`, every relationship has
  weight/distance/cost 1. If a `string`, use this relationship property as the
  relationship weight. Any relationship property not present defaults to 1.
- `method: string (default="dijkstra")` ➡ The algorithm used to compute the
  path lengths. Supported options: `dijkstra`, `bellman-ford`. Other inputs
  produce a `ValueError`. If `weight` is `None`, unweighted graph methods are
  used, and this suggestion is ignored.

  of the relationships. When set to `reverse`, every relationship is traversed
  in the reverse direction. When set to `ignore`, every relationship is treated
  as undirected. When set to `original`, every relationship is treated as
  directed. In all three cases, the returned relationship tuples add a last

  the breadth-first-search. For graphs, relationship is of the form `(u, v)`
  where `u` and `v` are the tail and head of the relationship as determined by

* `orientation: string (default=NULL)` ➡ For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, relationship traversals
  need not respect the original orientation of the relationships. When set to
  `reverse`, every relationship is traversed in the reverse direction. When set to
  `ignore`, every relationship is treated as undirected. When set to `original`,
  every relationship is treated as directed. In all three cases, the returned
  relationship tuples add a last entry to indicate the direction in which that
  relationship was traversed. If `orientation` is `None`, the returned
  relationship has no direction indicated. The direction is respected, but not
  reported.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `edges: List[Edge]` ➡ A directed relationship indicating the path taken by the
  depth-first traversal. For graphs, relationship is of the form `(u, v)` where

  traversal. For multigraphs, relationship is of the form `(u, v, key)`, where
  `key` is the key of the relationship. When the graph is directed, then `u` and
  `v` are always in the order of the actual directed relationship. If
  `orientation` is not `None` then the relationship tuple is extended to include
  the direction of traversal (`forward` or `reverse`) on that relationship.

* `orientation: string (default=NULL)` ➡ For directed graphs and directed
  multigraphs, relationship traversals need not respect the original orientation
  of the relationships. When set to `reverse` every relationship is traversed in
  the reverse direction. When set to `ignore`, every relationship is treated as
  undirected. When set to `original`, every relationship is treated as directed.
  In all three cases, the yielded relationship tuples add a last entry to indicate
  the direction in which that relationship was traversed. If `orientation` is
  `None`, the yielded relationship has no direction indicated. The direction is
  respected, but not reported.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `cycle: List[Edge]` ➡ A list of directed relationships indicating the path taken for
  the loop. If no cycle is found, then an exception is raised. For graphs, an
  relationship is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` are the tail and the head of

  form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is the key of the relationship. When the graph is
  directed, then `u` and `v` are always in the order of the actual directed
  relationship. If `orientation` is not `None` then the relationship tuple is extended to
  include the direction of traversal (`forward` or `reverse`) on that relationship.

  representing a function) that provides the coloring strategy, by returning nodes
  in the order they should be colored. `G` is the graph, and `colors` is a

  return an iterable over all the nodes in `G`. If the strategy function is an
  iterator generator (a function with `yield` statements), keep in mind that the
  `colors` dictionary will be updated after each `yield`, since this function
  chooses colors greedily. If `strategy` is a string, it must be one of the

  interchange with your own strategy function, you cannot rely on the values in
  the `colors` argument.

Find simple cycles (elementary circuits) of a directed graph. A *simple cycle*,
or *elementary circuit*, is a closed path where no node appears twice. Two
elementary circuits are distinct if they are not cyclic permutations of each
other. This is a nonrecursive, iterator/generator version of Johnson’s
algorithm. There may be better algorithms for some cases.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.


{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `cycles: List[List[Vertex]]` ➡ A list of elementary cycles in the graph. Each
  cycle is represented by a list of nodes in the cycle.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

TO find simple cycles, run the following query:

```cypher
CALL nxalg.simple_cycles() 
YIELD cycles
RETURN cycles;
```

### `strongly_connected_components()`

Returns nodes in strongly connected components of a graph.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.


{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `components: List[List[Vertex]]` ➡ A list of lists of nodes, one for each strongly connected component of `G`.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To get nodes in a stronly connected components, run the following query:

```cypher
CALL nxalg.strongly_connected_components() 
YIELD components
RETURN components;
```

### `topological_sort()`

Returns nodes in a topologically sorted order. A *topological sort* is a non
unique permutation of the nodes such that an relationship from `u` to `v`
implies that `u` appears before `v` in the topological sort order.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.


{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `nodes: List[Vertex]` ➡ A list of nodes in topological sorted order.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To return nodes in a topologically sorted order, run the following query:

```cypher
CALL nxalg.topological_sort() 
YIELD nodes
RETURN nodes;
```

### `triadic_census()`

Determines the triadic census of a directed graph. The *triadic census* is a
count of how many of the 16 possible types of triads are present in a directed
graph.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.


{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `triad: string` ➡ Triad name.
* `count: integer` ➡ Number of occurrences as value.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To determine the triadic census, run the following query:

```cypher
CALL nxalg.triadic_census() 
YIELD triad, count
RETURN triad, count;
```

### `voronoi_cells()`

Returns the Voronoi cells centered at center_nodes with respect to the
shortest-path distance metric. If `C` is a set of nodes in the graph and `c` is
an element of `C`, the *Voronoi cell* centered at a node `c` is the set of all
nodes `v` that are closer to `c` than to any other center node in `C` with
respect to the shortest-path distance metric. For directed graphs, this will
compute the “outward” Voronoi cells in which distance is measured from the
center nodes to the target node.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.

* `center_nodes: List[Vertex]` ➡ A nonempty set of nodes in the graph `G` that
  represent the centers of the Voronoi cells.
* `weight: string (default=NULL)` ➡ The relationship attribute (or an arbitrary
  function) representing the weight of an relationship. This keyword argument is
  as described in the documentation for `networkx.multi_source_dijkstra_path`,
  for example.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `center: Vertex` ➡ Vertex value of center_nodes.
* `cell: List[Vertex]` ➡ Partition of `G` closer to that center node.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To get the Vornoi cells, run the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (n)
WITH COLLECT(n) AS center_nodes
CALL nxalg.voronoi_cells(center_nodes)
YIELD counter, cell
RETURN center, cell;
```

### `wiener_index()`

Returns the Wiener index of the given graph. The *Wiener index* of a graph is
the sum of the shortest-path distances between each pair of reachable nodes. For
pairs of nodes in undirected graphs, only one orientation of the pair is
counted.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.

* `weight: string (default=NULL)` ➡ The relationship attribute to use as
distance when computing shortest-path distances. This is passed directly to the
`networkx.shortest_path_length` function.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `wiener_index: double` ➡ The Wiener index of the graph `G`.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

To get the Wiener index, run the following query:

```cypher
CALL nxalg.voronoi_cells() 
YIELD weiner_index
RETURN wiener_index;
```
