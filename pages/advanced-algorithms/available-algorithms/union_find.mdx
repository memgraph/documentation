# union_find

Analysis of connected components is a common task in graph analytics.

By using a disjoint-set data structure that keeps track of them, the algorithm
implemented in this module enables the user to quickly check whether a pair of
given nodes is in the same or different connected component. A check on a pair
of nodes is effectively executed in O(1) time.

The implementation of the disjoint-set data structure and its operations uses
the *union by rank* and *path splitting* optimizations described in Robert E.
Tarjan's and Jan van Leeuwen's "[Worst-case Analysis of Set Union
Algorithms](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62.2160)" and presented with
[examples](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/AlgsDS07/01UnionFind.pdf).

Too slow?

If this algorithm implementation is too slow for your use case, open an issue on [Memgraph's GitHub repository](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/issues) and request a rewrite to C++!

## Procedures

<Callout type="info">

You can execute this algorithm on [graph projections, subgraphs or portions of the graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph).

</Callout>

### `connected()`

Use the procedure to check whether a pair of given nodes is in the same or
different connected component. 

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run.
- `nodes1: Union[Vertex, List[Vertex]]` ➡ First value (or list thereof) in connectedness calculation.
- `nodes2: Union[Vertex, List[Vertex]]` ➡ Second value (or list thereof) in connectedness calculation.
- `mode: string (default="pairwise")` ➡ Mode of combining `nodes1` and `nodes2`. Can be ***p*** or ***pairwise*** for a pairwise product, or ***c*** or ***cartesian*** for a Cartesian product of the arguments. Pairwise by default.
- `update: boolean (default=True)` ➡ Specifies whether the disjoint-set data structure should be reinitialized. Enabled by default. If the graph has been modified since the previous call of this procedure, turning `update` off ensures that the changes are not visible in the output.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `node1: Vertex` ➡ Node in `nodes1`.
- `node2: Vertex` ➡ Node in `nodes2`.
- `connected: boolean` ➡ `True` if the above nodes are in the same connected component of the graph.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Analyze connected components using the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (m:Node)
WITH collect(m) AS nodes1
MATCH (n:Node)
WITH collect(n) AS nodes2, nodes1
CALL union_find.connected(nodes1, nodes2) 
YIELD node1, node2, connected
RETURN node1, node2, connected;
```

## Example

<Steps>

{<h3> Database state </h3>} 

The database contains the following data: 

![](/pages/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/union_find/union-find-1.png)

Created with the following Cypher queries:

```cypher
MERGE (a:Node {id: 0}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 1}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 1}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 2}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 2}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 0}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 3}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 4}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
MERGE (a:Node {id: 3}) MERGE (b:Node {id: 5}) CREATE (a)-[:RELATION]->(b);
```

{<h3> Analyze connected components </h3>} 

Check whether a pair of given nodes is in the same or different connected
component:

```cypher
MATCH (m:Node)
WHERE m.id = 0 OR m.id = 1
WITH collect(m) AS nodes1
MATCH (n:Node)
WHERE n.id = 2 OR n.id = 3
WITH collect(n) AS nodes2, nodes1
CALL union_find.connected(nodes1, nodes2) 
YIELD node1, node2, connected
RETURN node1, node2, connected;
```

Results:

```plaintext
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| node1           | node2           | connected       |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| (:Node {id: 0}) | (:Node {id: 2}) | false           |
| (:Node {id: 1}) | (:Node {id: 3}) | false           |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
```
