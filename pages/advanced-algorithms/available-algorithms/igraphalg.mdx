# igraphalg

The  **igraphalg** module provides a comprehensive set of thin wrappers around
some of the algorithms present in the [igraph](https://igraph.org/) package. The
wrapper functions can create an igraph compatible graph-like object that can
stream the native database graph directly, significantly lowering memory usage.

module, check Memgraph's native implementation of algorithms such as
[PageRank](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/pagerank), [shortest
path](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal), and
[others](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms) written in C++.

is a path with no repeated nodes.

### `topological_sort()`

Returns nodes in topologically sorted order. A *topological sort* is a
non-unique permutation of the nodes such that an edge from `u` to `v` implies

  relationships. For `out`, the sorting order ensures that each node comes
  before all nodes to which it has relationships, so nodes with no incoming
  relationships go first. For `in`, it is quite the opposite: each node comes
  before all nodes from which it receives relationships. Nodes with no outgoing
  relationships go first.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

- `nodes: List[Vertex]` ➡ A list of nodes in topological sorted order.

  Potts Model (CPM) or modularity. Must be either `CPM` or `modularity`.
- `weights: string (default=NULL)` ➡ If a string is present, use this property
  as the relationship weight if it isn't the weights default to 1.
