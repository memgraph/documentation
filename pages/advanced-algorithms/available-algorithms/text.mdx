## Procedures

### `join()`

Joins all the strings into a single one with the given delimiter between them.

<Callout type="info">
This procedure is equivalent to **apoc.text.join**.
</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.
- `strings: List[string]` ➡ A list of strings to be joined.
- `delimiter: string` ➡ A string to be inserted between the given strings.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Output: </h4>}

- `string: string` ➡ The joined string.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

To join strings, use the following query:

```cypher
CALL text.join(["idora", " ", "ivan", "", "matija"], ",") 
YIELD string 
RETURN string;
```

Result:

```plaintext
+----------------------------+
| string                     |
+----------------------------+
| "idora, ,ivan,,matija"     |
+----------------------------+
```

### `indexOf()`

Finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring within a string, with optional start and end position parameters.

<Callout type="info">
This function is equivalent to **apoc.text.indexOf**.
</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Input: </h4>}

- `text: string` ➡ The text string to search within.
- `lookup: string` ➡ The substring to search for.
- `from: integer` (default = 0) ➡ The starting position for the search (0-based index).
- `to: integer` (default = -1) ➡ The ending position for the search (-1 means search to the end of the string).

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Output: </h4>}

- `integer` ➡ The index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if not found.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

Use the following query to find the position of a substring:

```cypher
RETURN text.indexOf("Hello World!", "World", 0, -1) AS result;
```

Result:

```plaintext
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| 6      |
+--------+
```

### `regexGroups()`

The procedure returns all matched subexpressions of the regex on the provided
text using the [C++ regex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex) library.

<Callout type="info">
This procedure is equivalent to **apoc.text.regexGroups**.
</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.
- `input: string` ➡ Text that will be searched for regex subexpressions.
- `regex: string` ➡ Regex subexpression searched for in the text. 

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Output: </h4>}

- `results: List[List[string]]` ➡ All matched subexpressions. The inner list contains the whole subexpression and tokens matched inside.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

Use the following query to search for expressions: 

```cypher
CALL text.regexGroups("Memgraph: 1\nSQL: 2", "(\\w+): (\\d+)")
YIELD results
RETURN results;
```

Result:

```plaintext
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| results                                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| [["Memgraph: 1", "Memgraph", "1"], ["SQL: 2", "SQL", "2"]] |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### `format()`

The procedure formats strings using the [C++ fmt library](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt).

<Callout type="info">
This procedure is equivalent to **apoc.text.format**.
</Callout>

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Input: </h4>}

- `subgraph: Graph` (**OPTIONAL**) ➡ A specific subgraph, which is an [object of type Graph](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms#run-procedures-on-subgraph) returned by the `project()` function, on which the algorithm is run. 
If subgraph is not specified, the algorithm is computed on the entire graph by default.
- `text: string` ➡ Text that needs to be formatted.
- `parameters: string` ➡ Parameters which will be applied to the text.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Output: </h4>}

- `result: string` ➡ Formatted string.

{<h4 className="custom-header"> Usage: </h4>}

Use the following queries to insert the parameters to the placeholders in the sentence:

```cypher
CALL text.format("Memgraph is the number {} {} in the world.", [1, "graph database"])
YIELD result
RETURN result;
```

Result:

```plaintext
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| result                                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| "Memgraph is the number 1 graph database in the world. "|
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```
