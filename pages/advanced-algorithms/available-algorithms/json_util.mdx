A module for loading JSON from a local file or remote address. If the JSON that
is being loaded is an array, then this module loads it as a stream of values,
and if it is a map, the module loads it as a single value.

## Procedures

### `load_from_path()`

The procedure loads data from a local JSON file.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

* `path: string` ➡ Path to the JSON that needs to be loaded.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `objects: List[object]` ➡ The list of JSON objects from the file that is being loaded.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Use the folowing query to load data from a local JSON file:

```cypher
CALL json_util.load_from_path(path) 
YIELD objects
RETURN objects;
```

### `load_from_url()`

The procedure loads data from a JSON file at a specified URL.

{<h4> Input: </h4>}

* `url: string` ➡ URL to the JSON that needs to be loaded.

{<h4> Output: </h4>}

* `objects: List[object]` ➡ A list of JSON objects from the file that is being loaded.

{<h4> Usage: </h4>}

Use the following query to load data from a JSON file at a specified URL:

```cypher
CALL json_util.load_from_url(url) 
YIELD objects
RETURN objects;
```

## Examples

### Load JSON from path

<Steps>

{<h3> Input file </h3>}

The `data.json` file is located in the `load-data` directory with the following
content:

```json
{
	"first_name": "Jessica",
	"last_name": "Rabbit",
	"pets": [
		"dog",
		"cat",
		"bird"
	]
}
```

{<h3> Import data </h3>}

Run the query to load the data from the file:

```cypher
CALL json_util.load_from_path("load-data/data.json") 
YIELD objects
UNWIND objects AS o
RETURN o.first_name AS name, o.last_name AS surname;
```

Results:

```plaintext
+------------------+-------------------+
| name             | surname           |
+------------------+-------------------+
| Jessica          | Rabbit            |
+------------------+-------------------+
```
</Steps>

### Load JSON from URL

<Steps>

{<h3> Input file </h3>}

	"last_name": "Bond",
	"pets": [
		"dog",
		"cat",
		"fish"
	]
}
```

{<h3> Import data </h3>}

Run the query to load the data from the file at the URL:

```cypher
CALL json_util.load_from_url("https://download.memgraph.com/asset/mage/data.json") 
YIELD objects
UNWIND objects AS o
RETURN o.first_name AS name, o.last_name AS surname;
```

Results:
