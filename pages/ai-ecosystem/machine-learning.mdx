# Machine learning

Memgraph has been a popular choice in the AI world for a while now, especially
for the use cases around machine learning (ML). The MAGE library aims to provide
the most commonly used graph algorithms, and that includes [graph ML
algorithms](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms#graph-ml-algorithms) as
well. 

## Node embeddings

Supervised machine learning is a subset of ML where algorithms try to learn from
data. Modeling the interactions between entities as graphs has enabled
researchers to understand the various networks systematically. For the computer
to understand these networks, embedding a large graph in low dimensional space
is necessary, creating node embeddings. It has been demonstrated that graph
embedding is superior to alternatives in many supervised learning tasks, such as
**node classification** and **link prediction**, which are usually used for
friendship or content recommendations and advertisement.

Here are the MAGE algorithms which create node embeddings:
- [node2vec](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/node2vec): An algorithm
  for calculating node embeddings on a static graph.
- [node2vec_online](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/node2vec_online):
  An algorithm for calculating node embeddings on a dynamic graph.

## Graph neural networks

Using the node2vec algorithm to determine node embeddings works well, but graph
neural networks (GNNs) are more precise. GNNs aim to get the node
representations automatically and efficiently by iteratively aggregating the
representations of node neighbors and combining them with their representation
from the previous iteration. GNNs can inductively learn about your dataset,
which means that after training is complete, you can apply their knowledge to a
similar use case, meaning you don't have to retrain the whole algorithm.

## Temporal graph networks

Temporal graph networks (TGNs) are GNNs which work on temporal graph networks,
meaning they deal with continuous-time dynamic graphs.
