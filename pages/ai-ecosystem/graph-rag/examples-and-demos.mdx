## Featured demos

<h3 className="custom-header">Agentic GraphRAG with Memgraph</h3>

An agentic GraphRAG application that automatically performs GraphRAG operations
to answer questions. The application determines the best retrieval and reasoning
strategy based on the query, making it completely dataset-agnostic. It
automatically performs operations like vector search, deep path traversals,
community detection and PageRank.
