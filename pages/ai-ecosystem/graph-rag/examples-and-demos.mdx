## Featured demos

### Agentic GraphRAG with Memgraph 

An agentic GraphRAG application that automatically performs GraphRAG operations
to answer questions. The application determines the best retrieval and reasoning
strategy based on the query, making it completely dataset-agnostic. It
automatically performs operations like vector search, deep path traversals,
community detection and PageRank.
