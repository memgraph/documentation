# Prerequisites

To begin, you’ll need to set up and familiarize yourself with Memgraph, the foundation of your GraphRAG system.

## Getting started with Memgraph 

To begin your GraphRAG journey, you’ll need Memgraph MAGE set up and ready to go. If
you’re new to Memgraph, follow the [getting started guide](/getting-started) for detailed
installation and setup instructions.

## Requirements for GraphRAG 

GraphRAG systems involve combining graph databases with LLMs. Here’s what you’ll
need to set up for success:

- A running Memgraph MAGE instance
- Knowledge graph stored in Memgraph - identify your structured or unstructured
  data to convert into a knowledge graph and follow Memgraph's [data
  modeling](/data-modeling) docs to design your graph. 
- LLM API - use the large language model of your choice.

Building a GraphRAG system involves multiple building blocks, and selecting the
right ones isn’t straightforward. 

Before you begin, carefully consider what information the LLM needs that it
wouldn’t have without the knowledge graph. Identify the key context to provide,
and prioritize the most relevant data for inference. 

Remember, creating an ideal system rarely happens on the first try—iteration and
evaluation are essential.

### Hardware requirements 

Since Memgraph is an in-memory graph database, the hardware requirements depend
on the size of your dataset and the complexity of your queries.

1. **Memory**: Sufficient RAM is essential for storing and processing your
   dataset in memory. To estimate your needs, refer to
   our [RAM calculation guide](/help-center/faq#how-much-ram-do-i-need-for-my-graph).
2. **Storage**: While Memgraph operates in memory, storage is required for
   backups, snapshots, and write-ahead logs (WAL) to ensure data durability.
   Learn more about best practices in
   our [storage FAQ](/help-center/faq#what-are-the-minimum-and-recommended-requirements-to-run-a-on-premise-instance).

## Next steps

Once your environment is ready:

1. Proceed
   to [Knowledge graph creation](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag/knowledge-graph-creation) to
   model and import your data into Memgraph.
2. Explore [GraphRAG features](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag/knowledge-retrieval) to
   understand how to retrieve and manage knowledge effectively.
3. Review [Examples and demos](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag/examples-and-demos) for
   inspiration on building your own GraphRAG system.
