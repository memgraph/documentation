# Integrations

Memgraph offers several integrations with popular AI frameworks to help you
customize and build your own GenAI application from scratch. Below are some of
the libraries integrated with Memgraph.

## LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible data framework for connecting custom data
sources to large language models. Currently, [Memgraph's
integration](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/storage/graph_stores/memgraph/)
supports creating a knowledge graph from unstructured data and querying with
natural language. You can follow the example on [LlamaIndex
docs](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/property_graph/property_graph_memgraph/)
or go through quick start below.

{<h4 className="custom-header">Installation</h4>}

To install LlamaIndex and Memgraph graph store, run:

```shell
pip install llama-index llama-index-graph-stores-memgraph
```

{<h4 className="custom-header">Environment setup</h4>}

Before you get started, make sure you have [Memgraph](/getting-started) running
in the background.

To use Memgraph as the underlying graph store for LlamaIndex, define your graph
store by providing the credentials used for your database:

```python
from llama_index.graph_stores.memgraph import MemgraphPropertyGraphStore

username = ""  # Enter your Memgraph username (default "")
password = ""  # Enter your Memgraph password (default "")
url = ""  # Specify the connection URL, e.g., 'bolt://localhost:7687'

graph_store = MemgraphPropertyGraphStore(
    username=username,
    password=password,
    url=url,
)
```

Additionally, a working OpenAI key is required:

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"  # Replace with your OpenAI API key
```

{<h4 className="custom-header">Dataset</h4>}

For the dataset, we'll use a text about Charles Darwin stored in the
`/data/charles_darwin/charles.txt` file:

```
Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist,
widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology. His proposition that
all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally
accepted and considered a fundamental scientific concept. In a joint publication
with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this
branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural
selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the
artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described
as one of the most influential figures in human history and was honoured by
burial in Westminster Abbey.
```

```python
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/charles_darwin/").load_data()
```

The data is now loaded in the documents variable which we'll pass as an argument 
in the next step of index creation and graph construction.

{<h4 className="custom-header">Graph construction</h4>}

LlamaIndex provides multiple [graph
constructors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide/#construction).
In this example, we'll use the
[SchemaLLMPathExtractor](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide/#schemallmpathextractor),
which allows to both predefine the schema or use the one LLM provides without
explicitly defining entities.

```python
from llama_index.core import PropertyGraphIndex
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.core.indices.property_graph import SchemaLLMPathExtractor

index = PropertyGraphIndex.from_documents(
    documents,
    embed_model=OpenAIEmbedding(model_name="text-embedding-ada-002"),
    kg_extractors=[
        SchemaLLMPathExtractor(
            llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.0),
        )
    ],
    property_graph_store=graph_store,
    show_progress=True,
)
```

In the below image, you can see how the text was transformed into a knowledge
graph and stored into Memgraph.

{<h4 className="custom-header">Querying</h4>}

Labeled property graphs can be queried in several ways to retrieve nodes and
paths and in LlamaIndex, several node retrieval methods at once can be combined.

If no sub-retrievers are provided, the defaults are
[LLMSynonymRetriever](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide/#default-llmsynonymretriever)
and
[VectorContexRetriever](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide/#default-if-supported-vectorcontextretriever),
if supported.

From the latest update, LlamaIndex utilizes Memgraph's **[vector search](/querying/vector-search)** feature in
the background to enhance retrieval. This integration enables faster and more
accurate querying by leveraging vector similarity searches for embeddings stored
in the graph, leading to precise and context-aware answers.

```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(include_text=True)

response = query_engine.query("Who did Charles Robert Darwin collaborate with?")
print(str(response))
```

In the image below, you can see what's happening under the hood to get the answer.

## LangChain

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language
models (LLMs). Currently, Memgraph's LangChain integration supports
creating a knowledge graph from unstructured data and querying with natural
language. You can follow the example on [LangChain
docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/graphs/memgraph/) or go
through quick start below.

{<h4 className="custom-header">Installation</h4>}

To install all the required packages, run:

```shell
pip install langchain langchain-openai neo4j --user
```

{<h4 className="custom-header">Environment setup</h4>}

Before you get started, make sure you have [Memgraph](/getting-started) running
in the background.

Then, instantiate `MemgraphGraph` in your Python code. This object holds the
connection to the running Memgraph instance. Make sure to set up all the
environment variables properly.

```python
import os

from langchain_community.chains.graph_qa.memgraph import MemgraphQAChain
from langchain_community.graphs import MemgraphGraph
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

url = os.environ.get("MEMGRAPH_URI", "bolt://localhost:7687")
username = os.environ.get("MEMGRAPH_USERNAME", "")
password = os.environ.get("MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD", "")

graph = MemgraphGraph(
    url=url, username=username, password=password, refresh_schema=False
)
```

The `refresh_schema` is initially set to `False` because there is still no data in
the database and we want to avoid unnecessary database calls.

To interact with the LLM, you must configure it. Here is how you can set API key as an
environment variable for OpenAI:

```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-key-here"
```

{<h4 className="custom-header">Graph construction</h4>}

For the dataset, we'll use the following text about Charles Darwin:

```python
text = """
    Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist,
    widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology. His proposition that
    all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally
    accepted and considered a fundamental scientific concept. In a joint
    publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that
    this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural
    selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the
    artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been
    described as one of the most influential figures in human history and was
    honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.
"""
```

To construct the graph, first initialize `LLMGraphTransformer` from the desired
LLM and convert the document to the graph structure.

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name="gpt-4-turbo")
llm_transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(llm=llm)
documents = [Document(page_content=text)]
graph_documents = llm_transformer.convert_to_graph_documents(documents)
```

The graph structure in the `GraphDocument` format can be forwarded to the
`add_graph_documents()` procedure to import in into Memgraph:

```python
# Make sure the database is empty
graph.query("STORAGE MODE IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL")
graph.query("DROP GRAPH")
graph.query("STORAGE MODE IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL")

# Create KG
graph.add_graph_documents(graph_documents)
```

The `add_graph_documents()` procedure transforms the list of `graph_documents`
into appropriate Cypher queries and executes them in Memgraph.

In the below image, you can see how the text was transformed into a knowledge
graph and stored into Memgraph.

![langchain-kg](/pages/ai-ecosystem/integrations/langchain-kg-creation.png)

For additional options, check the [full
guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/graphs/memgraph/#additional-options)
on the LangChain docs. 

{<h4 className="custom-header">Querying</h4>}

In the end, you can query the knowledge graph:

```python
chain = MemgraphQAChain.from_llm(
    ChatOpenAI(temperature=0),
    graph=graph,
    model_name="gpt-4-turbo",
    allow_dangerous_requests=True,
)
print(chain.invoke("Who Charles Robert Darwin collaborated with?")["result"])
```
Here is the result:
```
MATCH (:Person {id: "Charles Robert Darwin"})-[:COLLABORATION]->(collaborator)
RETURN collaborator;
Alfred Russel Wallace
```

In the image below, you can see what's happening under the hood to get the
answer.
