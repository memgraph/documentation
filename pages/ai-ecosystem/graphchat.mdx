# Natural language querying with GraphChat

GraphChat allows you to:

- Instead of writing Cypher queries, ask natural language questions about your
  dataset directly from the [Memgraph Lab
  interface](/data-visualization).
- See behind-the-scenes details, including the generated Cypher query and its
  results.
- Debug with ease by examining query execution and results.

## Benefits

- **Ease of use**: Query your graph database as if you're having a conversation.
- **Transparency**: View the Cypher query generated by the LLM, the JSON
  results and the final summarized response.
- **Guided conversations**: Use precise prompts to guide the LLM based on how
  your data is structured.
- **Instant insights**: Quickly extract meaningful insights from your datasets.

## GraphChat with GraphRAG

The engineering flow behind GraphChat involves a seamless process that combines graph database querying with LLMs:

### 1. Retrieve the graph schema 

GraphChat first fetches your graph schema from Memgraph to understand the data
structure and relationships.

### 2. Send the question to the LLM

Your natural language query and the graph schema are sent to the LLM for
processing.

### 3. Generate the Cypher query

The LLM generates a Cypher query tailored to your graph schema.

### 4. Run the query in Memgraph

The Cypher query is executed on Memgraph to retrieve results.

### 5. Summarize the results

The results (in JSON format) are sent back to the LLM, which summarizes them in
natural language.


This flow enables both **data aggregation** and **GraphRAG queries**. While GraphChat currently supports straightforward queries, more complex graph traversal capabilities are under development.
