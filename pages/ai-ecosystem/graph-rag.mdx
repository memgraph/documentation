# GraphRAG with Memgraph


LLMs have the knowledge they were trained on. By building a RAG, you're
expanding that knowledge with your data. It is important to understand how to
**structure and model** the data and how to **find and extract relevant
information** for LLM to provide more accurate responses personalized to your
specific data.

**GraphRAG is a RAG system that combines the strengths of knowledge graphs and
LLMs**. Knowledge graphs are a structured representation of information where
entities and their relationships are organized to enable reasoning and insights.

Here are the main strengths of graph in a RAG system:
- **Relational context** - Knowledge graph structure holds the information about
  semantics.
- **Improved retrieval accuracy** - Having retrieval strategies specific to
  graphs, such as community detection and impact analytics.
- **Multi-hop reasoning** - Ability to traverse through data neighborhoods.
- **Efficient information navigation** - Scanning subgraphs instead of full
  datasets.
- **Dynamically evolving knowledge** - Updating graph in real time.

**Graph structure is a prerequisite for GraphRAG, and a graph database is even
better**. A GraphRAG application running in production needs **scalability**,
**real-time performance**, **incremental updates** and **persistence**. Having a
graph database as a part of the GraphRAG is especially useful if other
application parts also rely on the graph database.


## Key Memgraph features

Memgraph is a graph database that stores your knowledge graph, and it ensures
[durability](/fundamentals/data-durability) of stored data for backup and
recovery. Refer to our [data modeling](/data-modeling) and
[knowledge graph modeling](/data-modeling/knowledge-graph) guide for tips and tricks on how to model your
knowledge.

With Memgraph as an in-memory graph database, you can quickly traverse through
your graph with [deep path traversals](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal)
and not worry about latency. 

You can [ingest streaming data](/data-streams) into Memgraph with Kafka,
Redpanda or Pulsar which you can then query with (dynamic) MAGE algorithms or
your custom procedures. That allows you to have a growing knowledge graph that's
being updated on-the-fly. 

Here are the most useful features in Memgraph to build a GraphRAG:

- [Deep-path traversals](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal)
- [Leiden community
  detection](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/leiden_community_detection):
  Proven to be a better and faster version of Louvain community detection,
  guaranteeing well-connected communities. It is usually used in the second step
  of finding and extracting relevant information (relevance expansion).
- [Louvain community
  detection](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/community_detection) 
- [Dynamic community
  detection](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/community_detection_online)
- [PageRank](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/pagerank)
- [Dynamic PageRank](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/pagerank_online)
- [Text search](/querying/text-search)
- [Run-time schema tracking](/querying/schema#run-time-schema-tracking)
- **Coming soon** - Vector search - Usually used in the first
  step of finding and extracting relevant information (pivot search)

Here is how those features fit into the GraphRAG architecture:

## Tools 

[GraphChat](/data-visualization/user-manual/graphchat) is a Memgraph Lab feature
that allows users to extract insights from a graph database by asking questions
in plain English. It incorporates elements of GraphRAG. This two-phase
Generative AI app first generates Cypher queries from the text and then
summarizes the query results in the final response.

## Integrations

Memgraph offers several integrations with popular AI frameworks to help you
customize and build your own GenAI application from scratch. Below are some of
the libraries integrated with Memgraph.

{<h4>LangChain</h4>}

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language
models (LLMs). Currently, with Memgraph's LangChain integration you can query
your graph database with natural language. The example can be found on the
[LangChain
documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/graphs/memgraph/). 

<Callout type="info">
We are in the process of updating and improving the integration. We added a
support to build a knowledge graph from unstructured data and improved schema
generation speed. To track progress and speed things up, please upvote the [PR on LangChain
GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/27017) üëç.
</Callout>

{<h4>LlamaIndex</h4>}

LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible data framework for connecting custom data
sources to large language models. Currently, [Memgraph's
integration](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/storage/graph_stores/memgraph/)
supports creating a knowledge graph from unstructured data and querying with
natural language. You can follow the example on [LlamaIndex
docs](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/property_graph/property_graph_memgraph/)
or go through quick start below.

{<h5>Installation</h5>}

To install LlamaIndex and Memgraph graph store, run:

```shell
pip install llama-index llama-index-graph-stores-memgraph
```

{<h5>Environment setup</h5>}
Before you get started, make sure you have [Memgraph](/getting-started) running
in the background.

To use Memgraph as the underlying graph store for LlamaIndex, define your graph
store by providing the credentials used for your database:

```python
from llama_index.graph_stores.memgraph import MemgraphPropertyGraphStore

username = ""  # Enter your Memgraph username (default "")
password = ""  # Enter your Memgraph password (default "")
url = ""  # Specify the connection URL, e.g., 'bolt://localhost:7687'

graph_store = MemgraphPropertyGraphStore(
    username=username,
    password=password,
    url=url,
)
```

Additionally, a working OpenAI key is required:

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"  # Replace with your OpenAI API key
```

{<h5>Dataset</h5>}
For the dataset, we'll use a text about Charles Darwin stored in the
`/data/charles_darwin/charles.txt` file:

```
Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist,
widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology. His proposition that
all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally
accepted and considered a fundamental scientific concept. In a joint publication
with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this
branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural
selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the
artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described
as one of the most influential figures in human history and was honoured by
burial in Westminster Abbey.
```

```python
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/charles_darwin/").load_data()
```

The data is now loaded in the documents variable which we'll pass as an argument 
in the next step of index creation and graph construction.


{<h5>Graph construction</h5>}

LlamaIndex provides multiple [graph
constructors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide/#construction).
In this example, we'll use the
[SchemaLLMPathExtractor](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide/#schemallmpathextractor),
which allows to both predefine the schema or use the one LLM provides without
explicitly defining entities.

```python
from llama_index.core import PropertyGraphIndex
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.core.indices.property_graph import SchemaLLMPathExtractor

index = PropertyGraphIndex.from_documents(
    documents,
    embed_model=OpenAIEmbedding(model_name="text-embedding-ada-002"),
    kg_extractors=[
        SchemaLLMPathExtractor(
            llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.0),
        )
    ],
    property_graph_store=graph_store,
    show_progress=True,
)
```

In the below image, you can see how the text was transformed into a knowledge
graph and stored into Memgraph.

![llama-index](/pages/ai-ecosystem/llamaindex-kg.png)

{<h5>Querying</h5>}

Labeled property graphs can be queried in several ways to retrieve nodes and
paths and in LlamaIndex, several node retrieval methods at once can be combined.

If no sub-retrievers are provided, the defaults are
[LLMSynonymRetriever](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide/#default-llmsynonymretriever).

```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(include_text=True)

response = query_engine.query("Who did Charles Robert Darwin collaborate with?")
print(str(response))
```

In the image below, you can see what's happening under the hood to get the answer.
