# Clustering

To ensure redundancy and increase uptime, you can set up a cluster of Memgraph instances which can
guarantee you 24/7 uptime and availability of your graph dependent services.

With Memgraph Community, you gain [replication](/clustering/replication) capabilities out of the box.
You can set up a MAIN instance (writes and reads) with as many REPLICA instances (reads) as you want.
However, to achieve high availability, you need to manage automatic failover. 

On the other hand, Memgraph Enterprise has [high availability](/clustering/high-availability) features included in the
offering to ease the management of Memgraph clusters. In such case, the cluster
consists of: 
- MAIN instance
- REPLICA instances
- COORDINATOR instances (backed up by Raft protocol, manage the cluster state and perform leader election)

**We strongly suggest that user reads the guide on [how replication works](/clustering/concepts/how-replication-works)
in Memgraph on a logical level, before moving to the part of setting the cluster up.**
Choosing the appropriate number of Memgraph instances, as well as the replication mode on each
of them is crucial to understand, as that impacts performance and availability of the cluster based on your needs.

## [How replication works](/clustering/concepts/how-replication-works)

Learn about the underlying implementation and theoretical concepts behind Memgraph replication, including CAP theorem, replication modes, and synchronization mechanisms.

## [Replication guide (Community)](/clustering/replication)

Learn how to set up a replication cluster with Memgraph. 
**Replication is included in Memgraph Community**, making it accessible to all users who want to create data replicas across multiple instances.
Memgraph Community however does not ensure high availability itself, as **automatic failover is not included**. Community users are encouraged to 
perform the necessary steps themselves for keeping the replication cluster up and running.

## [High availability guide (Enterprise)](/clustering/high-availability)

Learn how to setup and manage a high availability cluster with Memgraph.
This guide is for users of **Memgraph Enterprise** who want to achieve clustering and 24/7 uptime.
