# Memgraph in production

When deploying Memgraph in production, it is essential to consider a set of prerequisites to ensure optimal **performance**, **scalability**
and **resilience**. That includes decisions about hardware configurations and integration strategies. 

This guide is your starting point to production-readiness with Memgraph.

## ✅ What you'll need to consider

Before you dive into specific setups, it's important to think about:
- **Hardware requirements** and **instance sizing**
- **Driver configuration** 
- **Flags**  when starting Memgraph 
- **Data import** best practices
- Connecting to **external sources** 

These factors ensure Memgraph performs effectively in your environment, no matter the use case.

## 📖 How to use these guides

Start with the [General suggestions](/memgraph-in-production/general-suggestions). They cover **best practices** that apply to most
production deployments, regardless of your workload type and are **agnostic to specific use cases**.
Each separate guide in the *Memgraph in Production* series focuses on a particular type of workload or deployment scenario.
At the beginning of each guide, you’ll find information about:
- When that **use case** is a good fit for your needs. 
- Specific tailored **recommendations**

⚠️ Recommendations in those guides **override** anything written in the
general suggestions when there's a conflict, so always defer to the targeted guide when applicable.
