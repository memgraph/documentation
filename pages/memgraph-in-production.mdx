# Memgraph in production

When deploying Memgraph in production, it is essential to consider a set of prerequisites to ensure optimal performance, 
scalability, and resilience. This includes hardware considerations, the correct sizing of instances, configuring drivers, using
appropriate flags when starting Memgraph, importing data, and connecting to external sources. The guidelines in this section will
help you make informed decisions for your specific use case, ensuring that Memgraph performs effectively in your environment.

## How to use the Memgraph in production guides

To get started, we recommend first reading the **General Suggestions** section, which outlines practices that are **agnostic to specific use cases**.
These are foundational principles that apply broadly across most production setups. Each separate guide in the **"Memgraph in Production"**
series focuses on a particular type of workload or deployment scenario. At the beginning of each guide, youâ€™ll find information about
**when that use case is a good fit for your needs**. The specific recommendations in those guides **override** anything written in the
general suggestions when there's a conflictâ€”so always defer to the targeted guide when applicable.
