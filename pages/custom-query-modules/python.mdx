# How to create a query module in Python

The [Python API](/custom-query-modules/python/python-api)
provided by Memgraph lets you develop query modules. It is accompanied by the
[mock
API](/custom-query-modules/python/mock-python-api),
which makes it possible to develop and test query modules for Memgraph without
having to run a Memgraph instance.

## Python API

Python API is defined in the `mgp` module that can be found in the Memgraph
installation directory `/usr/lib/memgraph/python_support`. In essence, it is a
wrapper around the C API. If you wish to write your own query modules using the
Python API, you need to have Python version `3.5.0` or above installed.

For more information, check the [Python API reference
guide](/custom-query-modules/python/python-api).<br/>
We also made [an example module](/custom-query-modules/python/python-example) to
help you start developing your own modules.

You can [develop query modules in Python from Memgraph
Lab](/custom-query-modules/python/implement-custom-query-module-in-python) (v2.0
and newer). Just navigate to **Query Modules** and click on **New Module** to
start.

Custom modules developed via Memgraph Lab are located at
`/var/lib/memgraph/internal_modules`.

### Mock Python API

The [mock Python query module API](/custom-query-modules/python/mock-python-api)
enables you to develop and test query modules for Memgraph without having to run
a Memgraph instance by simulating its behavior. As the mock API is compatible
with the [Python API](/custom-query-modules/python/python-api), you can add
modules developed with it to Memgraph as-is, without modifying the code.

For more information and examples, check the
[mock Python API reference guide](/custom-query-modules/python/mock-python-api).

## Install external Python libraries

It is possible to install Python libraries that are not already included with
Memgraph installation. For example, to install `pandas` with Memgraph running
inside a Docker container, run the following command in the terminal:

```console
docker exec -i -u root <container_id> bash -c "apt install -y python3-pip &&
pip install pandas"
```

Don't forget to replace `<container_id>` with the appropriate value, which you can
find by running `docker ps` command in the terminal.

If you are starting Memgraph with [Docker
Compose](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker-compose), write the following
commands in the Dockerfile:

```
FROM memgraph/memgraph:latest

USER root

RUN apt install -y python3-pip
RUN pip install pandas

USER memgraph
```

It is important that you install Python library as a `root` user, rather than
the default `memgraph` user.

## Example

In this tutorial, we will learn how to develop a query module in
Python on the example of the **random walk algorithm**.

## Prerequisites

There are three options for installing and working with Memgraph MAGE:

- [install MAGE development environment from Docker Hub](/custom-query-modules#install-mage-with-docker-hub)
- [build MAGE using the `docker build` command](/custom-query-modules#install-mage-with-docker-build)
- [build MAGE from source](/custom-query-modules#install-mage-from-source)

## Developing a module

Position yourself in the **MAGE repository** you cloned earlier. Specifically,
go in the `python` subdirectory and create a new file named `random_walk.py`.

```plaintext
mage
└── python
    └── random_walk.py

```

For coding the query module, we’ll use the
[`mgp`](https://github.com/memgraph/mgp) package that has the Memgraph Python
API including the key graph data structures:
[**Vertex**](https://github.com/memgraph/mgp/blob/main/mgp.py#L260) and
[**Edge**](https://github.com/memgraph/mgp/blob/main/mgp.py#L182).
To install `mgp`, run `pip install mgp`.

Here's the code for the random walk algorithm:

```python
import mgp
import random


@mgp.read_proc
def get_path(
    start: mgp.Vertex,
    length: int = 10,
) -> mgp.Record(path=mgp.Path):
    """Generates a random path of length `length` or less starting
    from the `start` vertex.

    :param mgp.Vertex start: The starting node of the walk.
    :param int length: The number of edges to traverse.
    :return: Random path.
    :rtype: mgp.Record(mgp.Path)
    """
    path = mgp.Path(start)
    vertex = start
    for _ in range(length):
        try:
            edge = random.choice(list(vertex.out_edges))
            path.expand(edge)
            vertex = edge.to_vertex
        except IndexError:
            break

    return mgp.Record(path=path)
```

The `get_path` is decorated with the `@mgp.read_proc` decorator, which tells
Memgraph it's a `read` procedure, meaning it won't make changes to the graph.
The path is created from the `start` node, and edges are appended to it
iteratively.

### Terminate procedure execution

Just as the execution of a Cypher query can be terminated with [`TERMINATE
TRANSACTIONS
"id";`](/fundamentals/transactions) query,
the execution of the procedure can as well, if it takes too long to yield a
response or gets stuck in an infinite loop due to unpredicted input data.

Transaction ID is visible upon calling the SHOW TRANSACTIONS; query. 

In order to be able to terminate the procedure, it has to contain function
`ctx.check_must_abort()` which precedes crucial parts of the code, such as
`while` and `until` loops, or similar points where the procedure might become
costly.

Consider the following example:

```python
import mgp

@mgp.read_proc
def long_query(ctx: mgp.ProcCtx) -> mgp.Record(my_id=int):
    id = 1
    try:
        while True:
            if ctx.check_must_abort():
                break
            id += 1
    except mgp.AbortError:
        return mgp.Record(my_id=id)
```

The `mgp.AbortError:` ensures that the correct message about termination is sent
to the session where the procedure was originally run.

## Working with the mock API

The
[mock Python API](/custom-query-modules/python/mock-python-api)
lets you develop and test query modules for Memgraph without having to run a
Memgraph instance. As it’s compatible with the Python API you can add modules
developed with it to Memgraph as-is, without having to refactor your code.

The documentation on importing the mock API and running query modules with it
is available
[here](/custom-query-modules/python/mock-python-api#using-the-mock-api),
accompanied by examples.

## Managing Memgraph's Python environment

After some time, any production system requires updates for the packages it
uses. For example, when developing a new query module that requires the latest
`networkx` version. 

If Memgraph is already deployed somewhere with an installed `networkx` package,
you would probably like to use some package manager, e.g. pip or conda, to
delete the old `networkx`, and install a new `networkx` package. You definitely
wouldn't want to redeploy the whole Memgraph just because of one Python package.

However, Python caches all modules, packages and the compiled bytecode, so this
procedure cannot work out of the box. So after installing the new package, you
need to use the utility procedure `mg.load_all()`. 

So the whole process looks like this:

Uninstall the old package:
```python
pip uninstall networkx
```
Install a new package:
```python
pip install networkx=<new_version>
```
Reload all query modules:
```cypher
CALL mg.load_all();
```
