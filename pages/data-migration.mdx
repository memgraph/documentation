# Data migration

Where is the data you want to migrate?
- [CSV files](#csv-files)
- [JSON files](#json-files)
- [CYPHERL files](#cypherl-files)
- [Neo4j](#neo4j)
- [Data from an application or a program](#data-from-an-application-or-a-program)
- [Relational database management system](#rdbms)
- [In a stream](#data-from-a-stream)
- [Parquet, ORC or IPC/Feather/Arrow file](#parquet-orc-or-ipcfeatherarrow-file)
- [NetworkX, PyG or DGL graph](#networkx-pyg-or-dgl-graph)

<Callout>

If you can choose the format of the data you want to import, the fastest way to
import data into Memgraph is from a [CSV file](/data-migration/csv) using the
LOAD CSV clause. 

</Callout>

## CSV files

To import data from [CSV files](/data-migration/csv) into Memgraph, use the LOAD
CSV clause, which is used as a standard Cypher clause, and can be invoked
straight from a running Memgraph instance.

## JSON files

You can import data from a [JSON file](/data-migration/json) into Memgraph
by using the [`json_util` query
module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/json_util), which contains
procedures for loading JSON file from a local file and from a remote address.

You can also use the [`import_util.json`
procedure](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/import_util#jsonpath) to
import data from a local JSON file, but the file needs to in a specific format
defined by the procedure. 

## CYPHERL files

If your data is in the form of Cypher queries (`CREATE` and `MERGE` clauses)
within a CYPHERL file it can be [imported via Memgraph
Lab or mgconsole](/data-migration/cypherl).

## Neo4j

Export the data into a CSV file and import it into Memgraph using the LOAD CSV
clause, like in this [example](/data-migration/migrate-from-neo4j). 

## Data from an application or a program

Memgraph offers a [wide range of client libraries](/client-libraries) that
can be used to connect directly to the platform and import data.

## Relational database management systems [#rdbms]

Ideally, export data into a CSV file, [remodeled the
data](/fundamentals/graph-modeling) and rewrite the CSV file, then import it
into Memgraph using the LOAD CSV clause, like in this
[example](/data-migration/migrate-from-rdbms). 

Alternatively, you can use the [`migration`
module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/migrate) from the MAGE graph
library which allows you to access data from a MySQL database, an SQL server or
an Oracle database. 

## Data from a stream

Memgraph comes with full streaming support, and you can connect directly to a
Kafka, Redpanda or Pulsar stream using [Cypher
queries](/data-streams/manage-streams-query) or [Memgraph
Lab](/data-streams/manage-streams-lab).

## Parquet, ORC or IPC/Feather/Arrow file

If you are a Python user you can import Parquet, ORC or IPC/Feather/Arrow file
into Memgraph using [GQLAlchemy](https://memgraph.github.io/gqlalchemy/how-to-guides/loaders/import-table-data-to-graph-database/).

## NetworkX, PyG or DGL graph

If you are a Python user you can import NetworkX, PyG or DGL graph into Memgraph
using [GQLAlchemy](https://memgraph.github.io/gqlalchemy/how-to-guides/translators/import-python-graphs/).

## Memgraph's office hours

Schedule a 30 min session with one of our engineers to discuss how Memgraph fits
with your architecture. Our engineers are highly experienced in helping
companies of all sizes to integrate and get the most out of Memgraph in their
projects. Talk to us about data modeling, optimizing queries, defining
infrastructure requirements or migrating from your existing graph database. No
nonsense or sales pitch, just tech.
