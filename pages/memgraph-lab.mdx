# Memgraph Lab

Memgraph Lab is a powerful visualization and management tool designed to help
users interact with Memgraph database efficiently. Whether youâ€™re just getting
started, executing complex queries, or leveraging advanced features, this
documentation provides the guidance you need to navigate and optimize your
workflow.

## Quick start

<Steps>

<h3 className="custom-header">Run Memgraph MAGE and Memgraph Lab</h3>

Depending on your operating system, execute the appropriate command in the console:

<Tabs items={['Linux/macOS', 'Windows']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
<CodeSnippet code="curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh" page="getting-started" os="linux/macOS"/>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
<CodeSnippet code="iwr https://windows.memgraph.com | iex" page="getting-started" os="windows"/>
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The above command will start Memgraph MAGE in a Docker container on the host
machine and expose port `7687` for Bolt connection and port `7444` for logs. The
command will also start Memgraph Lab in a Docker container and you can access it
on `localhost:3000`.

For other installation types, read the [installation and
deployment](/memgraph-lab/getting-started/installation-and-deployment)
documentation. 

<h3 className="custom-header">Connect to Memgraph</h3>

Access Memgraph Lab on `localhost:3000` in the browser. You will see the **Quick
connect** screen. To connect to Memgraph, click on **Connect now** button.

<h3 className="custom-header">Run queries</h3>

Now, you can execute Cypher queries in Memgraph. Open the **Query execution**
tab, located in the left sidebar, copy the following query and press the **Run
query** button:

```cypher
CREATE (u:User {name: "Alice"})-[:Likes]->(m:Software {name: "Memgraph"});
```

The query above will create 2 nodes in the database, one labeled `User` with
name `Alice` and the other labeled `Software` with name `Memgraph`. It will also
create a relationship that `Alice` _likes_ `Memgraph`.

To find created nodes and relationships, execute the following query:

```cypher
MATCH p=()-[]->() RETURN p;
```

You should get the following result:

## Features

Memgraph Lab provides a powerful and intuitive interface for working with graph
data, offering a range of features to streamline data import, visualization,
query execution, and collaboration.

Here is a list of advanced Memgraph Lab Enterprise features:

- [Monitoring](/memgraph-lab/features/monitoring) - A feature that tracks resource usage, database size, query
  activity, transaction flow, and active sessions, providing real-time insights
  into database performance.
- [Sharing features](/memgraph-lab/features/sharing-features) - Query sharing allows users to share selected queries from
  the query execution or previously run queries from the history. Graph Style
  Script (GSS) sharing allows users to share styling scripts among team members.
- [Single sign-on](/memgraph-lab/features/single-sign-on) - Provides authorization and authentification to your database.
  Supports two types of SSO methods - OpenID Connect (OIDC + OAuth 2.0) and
  SAML, and two identity providers - Microsoft Azure (Entra ID) and Okta. 

<Callout type="warning">
Some of the Enterprise features are not supported on the desktop version of
Memgraph Lab. All Enterprise features are supported in the Docker environment.
