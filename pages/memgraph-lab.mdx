## Quick start

<Steps>

<h3 className="custom-header">Run Memgraph MAGE and Memgraph Lab</h3>

Depending on your operating system, execute the appropriate command in the console:

<Tabs items={['Linux/macOS', 'Windows']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
<CodeSnippet code="curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh" page="getting-started" os="linux/macOS"/>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
<CodeSnippet code="iwr https://windows.memgraph.com | iex" page="getting-started" os="windows"/>
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

The above command will start Memgraph MAGE in a Docker container on the host
machine and expose port 7687 for Bolt connection and port 7444 for logs. The
command will also start Memgraph Lab in a Docker container and you can access it
on `localhost:3000`. 

For other installation types, read the [deployment and
installation](/memgraph-lab/getting-started/deployment-and-installation)
documentation. 

<h3 className="custom-header">Connect to Memgraph</h3>

Access Memgraph Lab on `localhost:3000` in the browser. You will see the Quick
Connect screen. To connect to Memgraph, click on **Connect now** button.
