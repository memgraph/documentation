# Install Memgraph Lab and connect to a database

We recommend you use the [Memgraph
Platform](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker-compose)
and get the complete streaming graph application platform that includes:

- **Memgraph** - the database that holds your data
- **Memgraph Lab** - visual user interface for running queries and visualizing
  graph data
- **mgconsole** - command-line interface for running queries
- **MAGE** - graph algorithms and modules library

After running the image, mgconsole will open in the terminal while Memgraph Lab
is available on `http://localhost:3000`. 

If you want to install Memgraph Lab as a desktop application, check out the
[installation instructions](#install-memgraph-lab-desktop-application) for
Windows, macOS and Linux, and if you have a public Memgraph database instance
you can access the Lab web application at [https://lab.memgraph.com/](https://lab.memgraph.com/).

## Install Memgraph Lab desktop application

<Steps>

{<h3>Download and install Memgraph</h3>} 

Memgraph Lab requires a [running Memgraph database instance](/getting-started).

If you installed Memgraph using Docker and wish to connect to it with the
Memgraph Lab desktop application, ensure that ports 7687, used for instance
connections (`-p 7687:7687`), and 7444, used for logs (`-p 7444:7444`), are
exposed in the `docker run ...` command.

<Callout type="info">

Connecting Memgraph Lab to Memgraph may vary depending on the deployment method
or operating system. The handling of the `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST` environment
variable [varies by operating
system](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker#issues-when-connecting-to-memgraph-lab-to-memgraph).

</Callout>


{<h3>Download Memgraph Lab</h3>}

Visit the [Download Hub](https://memgraph.com/download/#individual) and
download the Memgraph Lab desktop application.

{<h3>Install Memgraph Lab</h3>}

You can install Memgraph Lab by double clicking the downloaded installer and
following the instructions.

If you downloaded Memgraph Lab on Linux, you can execute:

```console
sudo dpkg -i MemgraphLab-x.x.x.deb
```

<Callout>

If you encounter a security warning while installing Memgraph Lab on Windows, you may see a message similar to the ones shown in the images below.

![](/pages/data-visualization/memgraph-lab-install-windows-1.png)

1. Click **More info**.

2. Verify that Memgraph is listed as the Publisher.

![](/pages/data-visualization/memgraph-lab-install-windows-2.png)

3. Click **Run anyway** to proceed with the installation of Memgraph Lab.

</Callout>

{<h3>Set up connection</h3>}

After you start Memgraph Lab, you should be presented with a login
screen. 

These are the default settings:

- Leave the `Username` and `Password` fields **empty**.
- The `Host` field can be either **`localhost`**, **`127.0.0.1`** or
   **`0.0.0.0`**, or change it appropriately. 
- The `Port` field should be **`7687`**. Every Memgraph instance is listening
   on this port by default.
- The `Encrypted` option should be **disabled** and display `SSL Off` by
   default.

{<h3>Connect</h3>}

Click on Connect, and you should be presented with the following dashboard:

![lab-dashboard](/pages/data-visualization/install-and-connect/lab-dashboard.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Memgraph Lab and connected it
to Memgraph. You are now ready to start building your graph and querying it.

<Callout type="warning">

You might receive the following error message when trying to connect.

![failed_connection](/pages/data-visualization/install-and-connect/failed_connection.png)

In this case, make sure that Memgraph is properly up and running and that you
have entered the correct port number.

</Callout>

{<h3>Execute queries</h3>}

Now, you can execute Cypher queries on Memgraph. Open the **Query** tab, located
in the left sidebar, copy the following query and press the **Run query**
button:

```cypher
CREATE (u:User {name: "Alice"})-[:Likes]->(m:Software {name: "Memgraph"});
```

The query above will create 2 nodes in the database, one labeled "User" with
name "Alice" and the other labeled "Software" with name "Memgraph". It will also
create a relationship that "Alice" _likes_ "Memgraph".

To find created nodes and relationships, execute the following query:

```cypher
MATCH p=()-[]->() RETURN p;
```

You should get the following result:

</Steps>

## Run Memgraph Lab with Docker

Run the Memgraph Lab Docker image using the following command:

```console
docker run -d -p 3000:3000  --name lab memgraph/lab
```

Once the container is up you can access Memgraph Lab on
[localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

#### Issues when connecting to Memgraph

Memgraph Lab detects if Memgraph is running on `localhost:7687` by default for the Quick Connect.
The environment variables that are responsible for Quick Connect working as expected are  `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST` and `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_PORT`. The handling of the
`QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST` environment variable differs based on the operating
system:

- **Mac or Windows**: The `host.docker.internal` hostname allows Docker
  containers to connect to the host machine. Set this as the value for
  `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST` when running Lab on Mac or Windows to enable
  connection to Memgraph running on the host:

  ```console
  docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST=host.docker.internal --name lab memgraph/lab
  ```

- **Linux**: There's no need to set `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST` as it defaults to
  `localhost`, assuming Memgraph is running locally on the host machine.

You can also use the `QUICK_CONNECT_MG_PORT` environment variable to specify the
quick connect port number, e.g. `- e QUICK_CONNECT_MG_PORT=7688`.

<Callout>

To connect to a running Memgraph instance, you don't need to set
`QUICK_CONNECT_MG_HOST` to `host.docker.internal`. Instead, create a new
connection in Memgraph Lab and specify `host.docker.internal` as the Host.

## Environment variables

<Callout type="info">

The desktop application version of Memgraph Lab does not support receiving environment variables.

When running Memgraph Lab using Docker, configure the environment variables to
adjust settings. Use the Docker `run` command as follows to set these variables:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name lab -e QUERY_MAX_LEN=10000 -e MODULE_NAME_MAX_LEN=2500 memgraph/lab
```

For Docker Compose, define the same environment variables within the
`environment` section of your service configuration in the `docker-compose.yml`
file:

```yaml
environment:
  - QUERY_MAX_LEN=10000
  - MODULE_NAME_MAX_LEN=2500
```
