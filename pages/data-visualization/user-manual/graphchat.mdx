## GraphChat

The GraphChat allows you to query the database using English language,
rather than Cypher queries.

To use GraphChat you require a valid OpenAPI key connection, the Memgraph
instance needs to have MAGE graph algorithm library installed and the database
needs to be populated. 

All the LLM settings can be adjusted in the **Settings** section.
