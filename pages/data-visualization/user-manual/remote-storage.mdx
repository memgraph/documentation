# Remote storage (Enterprise)

The Lab utilizes remote storage to securely store the shared data,
ensuring sensitive information is protected. Without remote storage,
Lab stores data in the browser where it becomes hard to share your
progress with your team members or in cases when you use the Lab from
different location or different browser.

<Callout type="info">

**Environment**: Remote storage is available exclusively when the Lab is
started in a Docker environment.

</Callout>

## How to set it up

Remote storage requires a [valid Memgraph Enterprise license](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise)
configured on the Lab side. Ensure that you configure the following
environment variables when running Lab with Docker:

| Variable                      | Description                          | Type       |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| `ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_ORG_NAME` | Enterprise license organization name | `string`   |
| `ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY`      | Enterprise license key               | `string`   |

For example:

```
docker run \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_ORG_NAME="My company" \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY="key..." \
  memgraph/lab
```

The enterprise license will be checked once you set up the
remote storage. Remote storage should be a
[new Memgraph instance](/data-visualization/user-manual/query-sharing#using-a-standalone-memgraph-instance-as-remote-storage)
or a [new Memgraph database in a multi-tenant environment](/data-visualization/user-manual/query-sharing#using-a-memgraph-multi-tenant-environment-as-remote-storage).

#### Using a standalone Memgraph instance as remote storage

In this scenario, Memgraph should be used only for Lab purposes to
store query-sharing information. Memgraph can be a community or
enterprise version. Make sure your Memgraph is running and then set
the following environment variables so Lab can connect to it for
remote storage capability.

These two environment variables are required:

| Variable                   | Description                                       | Type       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `STORAGE_MG_HOST`          | Memgraph host for the Lab remote storage          | `string`   |
| `STORAGE_MG_PORT`          | Memgraph port for the Lab remote storage          | `number`   |

These variables are optional and depend on the configuration of
the Memgraph instance:

| Variable                   | Description                                       | Type       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `STORAGE_MG_IS_ENCRYPTED`  | Memgraph SSL on/off for the Lab remote storage    | `boolean`  |
| `STORAGE_MG_USERNAME`      | Memgraph username for the Lab remote storage      | `string`   |
| `STORAGE_MG_PASSWORD`      | Memgraph password for the Lab remote storage      | `string`   |

If your Memgraph instance has SSL defined and there is a username `lab`
and password `lab`, the complete Docker command should look like this:

```
docker run \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_ORG_NAME="My company" \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY="key..." \
  -e STORAGE_MG_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
  -e STORAGE_MG_PORT=7867 \
  -e STORAGE_MG_IS_ENCRYPTED=true \
  -e STORAGE_MG_USERNAME=lab \
  -e STORAGE_MG_PASSWORD=lab \
  memgraph/lab
```

If there is no username or password and Memgraph is accepting
non-SSL connections, omit the optional environment variables:

```
docker run \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_ORG_NAME="My company" \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY="key..." \
  -e STORAGE_MG_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
  -e STORAGE_MG_PORT=7867 \
  memgraph/lab
```

Upon successful configuration, you should see the following log output
when starting the Lab:

```
INFO: [lab] Checking connectivity to remote storage *** with a timeout of *** ms...
INFO: [lab] Enterprise license applied successfully. Enjoy the premium features.
...
INFO: [lab] Remote storage *** successfully connected.
```

#### Using a Memgraph multi-tenant environment as remote storage

This scenario works only with Memgraph Enterprise because
[multi-tenancy](/database-management/multi-tenancy) is an enterprise
feature. In a multi-tenant environment, you can use your existing
Memgraph instance with a new database that Lab will use for remote
storage to store information.

These three environment variables are required:

| Variable                   | Description                                       | Type       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `STORAGE_MG_HOST`          | Memgraph host for the Lab remote storage          | `string`   |
| `STORAGE_MG_PORT`          | Memgraph port for the Lab remote storage          | `number`   |
| `STORAGE_MG_DATABASE_NAME` | Memgraph database name for the Lab remote storage | `string`   |

These variables are optional and depend on the configuration
of the Memgraph instance:

| Variable                   | Description                                       | Type       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `STORAGE_MG_IS_ENCRYPTED`  | Memgraph SSL on/off for the Lab remote storage    | `boolean`  |
| `STORAGE_MG_USERNAME`      | Memgraph username for the Lab remote storage      | `string`   |
| `STORAGE_MG_PASSWORD`      | Memgraph password for the Lab remote storage      | `string`   |

Let's say that you already created a new database called `lab`
in your enterprise Memgraph instance for remote storage. For better
security, it is recommended to always define usernames and passwords.
However, if it accepts non-SSL connections with no username or
password, the following command should make Lab successfully connect
to the remote storage:

```
docker run \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_ORG_NAME="My company" \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY="key..." \
  -e STORAGE_MG_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
  -e STORAGE_MG_PORT=7867 \
  -e STORAGE_MG_DATABASE_NAME=lab \
  memgraph/lab
```

If your Memgraph instance has SSL defined and there is a username `lab`
and password `lab`, the complete Docker command should look like this:

```
docker run \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_ORG_NAME="My company" \
  -e ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY="key..." \
  -e STORAGE_MG_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
  -e STORAGE_MG_PORT=7867 \
  -e STORAGE_MG_IS_ENCRYPTED=true \
  -e STORAGE_MG_USERNAME=lab \
  -e STORAGE_MG_PASSWORD=lab \
  memgraph/lab
```

Upon successful configuration, you should see the following log output
when starting the Lab:

```
INFO: [lab] Checking connectivity to remote storage *** with a timeout of *** ms...
INFO: [lab] Enterprise license applied successfully. Enjoy the premium features.
...
INFO: [lab] Remote storage *** successfully connected.
```
