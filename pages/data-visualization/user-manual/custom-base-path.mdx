## Setting up Memgraph Lab with a custom base path

Starting from the version 2.19.0, Memgraph Lab allows you to configure
a custom base path for the web application when running it in Docker.
This configuration is especially beneficial when using a reverse
proxy like NGINX to manage access to multiple applications.

To use this feature, you can define the environment variable `BASE_PATH`
when starting Memgraph Lab. For example, you can set `BASE_PATH`
to `/mylab`, and Memgraph Lab will be accessible at that base path
(e.g. `localhost:3000/mylab`).

## Configure Memgraph Lab

When running Memgraph Lab in Docker, specify the `BASE_PATH` environment
variable. For example:

```
docker run -e BASE_PATH=mylab -p 3000:3000 memgraph/lab
```

This starts Memgraph Lab on port 3000 and sets the base path
to `/mylab`.

## Configure NGINX for reverse proxy

Here is an example nginx.conf for redirecting requests to Memgraph Lab:

```
# nginx.conf
events {}

http {
  server {
    listen 8080;

    location /mylab/ {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/mylab/;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

      # WebSocket specific headers
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation of key configurations:
- `location`: This should match the base path. In the example above,
  base path is `/mylab`, and location is `/mylab/`.
- `proxy_pass`: This should match the Memgraph Lab host and include the
  same base path as defined in `BASE_PATH`. In the example above,
  the base path is `/mylab`, and proxy_pass is `http://localhost:3000/mylab/`.
- WebSocket headers: These headers ensure WebSocket communication, such as
  the Logs feature in the Lab UI, works correctly. Include `proxy_http_version 1.1`,
  `proxy_set_header Upgrade`, and `proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"`.

Special Note for Docker Networking: If both Memgraph Lab and the NGINX
server are running on the same machine, but you access them using Docker,
you can use `host.docker.internal` in proxy_pass instead of `localhost`.

For example:

```
proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:3000/mylab/;
```

</Callout>

## Accessing Memgraph Lab

After configuring the above settings, Memgraph Lab will be
accessible via the reverse proxy at:

```
http://<nginx-server-address>:8080/mylab/
```

Replace `<nginx-server-address>` with the actual address of your
NGINX server.
