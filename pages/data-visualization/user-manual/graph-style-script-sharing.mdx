# Graph Style Script sharing (Enterprise)

Graph Style Script (GSS) sharing is a feature introduced in Lab 3.0,
allowing users to share Graph Style Script among team members.

The Lab utilizes remote storage to securely store the scripts,
ensuring sensitive information is protected and allowing easier
collaboration.

<Callout>

Enterprise: GSS sharing requires a Memgraph Enterprise license to
function. For more information on Memgraph Enterprise and instructions
on how to enable it, refer to the
[enabling Memgraph Enterprise documentation](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).

</Callout>

<Callout>

Environment: GSS sharing is available exclusively when the Lab is
started in a Docker environment.

</Callout>

## How to set it up

For GSS sharing to function, the Lab requires a [remote storage](/data-visualization/user-manual/remote-storage)
connection where GSS will be saved. Remote storage should be
a new Memgraph instance or a new Memgraph database in a
multi-tenant environment.

Having remote storage enables users to connect from different
browsers to the same instance of Lab to see the same GSS scripts.

This setup also allows administrators to connect to Memgraph, which
acts as a remote storage, and access all users and GSS scripts.
Administrators can also perform migrations. It is essential
to set up authentication and role-based permissions in Memgraph
used as remote storage for the Lab to ensure data security.

## Managing Graph Style Scripts (GSS) in Lab

The Lab provides robust functionality for managing Graph Style
Scripts (GSS), allowing users to create, save, and share styles
for graph visualization. With the introduction of remote storage
for GSS, users now have the flexibility to combine in-browser
GSS with remote storage, tailoring their workflow to suit
individual or team needs.

### Understanding Storage Options for GSS

#### In-Browser Storage

In-browser GSS are stored locally in the user’s web browser. These
scripts are accessible only within the same browser and on the same
device where they were created or saved.

Key Features of In-Browser GSS:

- Save custom GSS: Users can create and save GSS scripts directly
  in their browser.
- Load saved GSS: Any GSS script saved in the browser can be
  loaded for use at any time.
- System default script: Load the system-provided default
  script for graph visualization.
- Custom default script: Designate any custom GSS as the default
  script to override the system default for that browser instance.

Limitations:

- In-browser GSS are device and browser-specific. They cannot be
  accessed from other devices or browsers.

#### Remote Storage

Remote storage for GSS is a feature available as part of the Enterprise
license. This option allows users to save GSS scripts in a centralized
storage system, enabling access from any device or browser connected
to the same Lab instance.

Key Features of Remote Storage GSS:

- Save and share GSS: Store GSS scripts in the remote storage with
  flexible sharing permissions:
  - Private: Visible only to the creator.
  - Public: Accessible to any authenticated user connected to the
    same Lab instance.
- Edit shared scripts: Creators of a shared GSS can update its
  name, code, and privacy settings.
- Copy to in-browser storage: Users can copy a remote GSS script to
  their browser storage, particularly useful for setting up a
  system default script.

Benefits:

- Centralized access to GSS from any location or device.
- Collaboration through shared scripts while maintaining privacy controls.

### Combining In-browser and Remote storage

The Lab enables seamless integration of in-browser and remote
storage, allowing users to:

1. Use local and shared scripts: Access GSS stored locally in the browser
   alongside shared scripts from remote storage.
2. Switch between storage types: Decide whether to save and retrieve GSS
   scripts locally or from the remote storage based on accessibility and
   collaboration needs.
3. Copy scripts across storages: Transfer a remote GSS script to in-browser
   storage or vice versa, depending on the workflow.

### Workflow Examples

Individual workflow (In-browser focused):

- A user creates a custom GSS in their browser for personal use.
- The script is saved locally and set as the default for all graph
  visualizations in that browser.
- If the user moves to a new device, they will need to recreate or
  copy the script manually.

Collaborative workflow (Remote storage focused):

- A team member creates a shared GSS script in remote storage
  and sets it as public.
- Other authenticated users can access and use the script from
  their devices.
- The script’s creator updates it as needed, ensuring consistency
  across the team.

Hybrid workflow:

- A user saves a GSS in remote storage for collaboration.
- For personal tweaks, they copy the shared GSS to their in-browser
  storage and set it as the default on their device.
- The user can switch between the remote and local versions depending
  on the context.








#### User actions

Users can perform three primary actions with Query sharing:

##### Create a query share

A user can create a query share from the query execution editor.
When a query share is created, the Lab stores information about the
creator and all necessary details to run the query, including:

* Cypher query
* Graph Style Script
* Cypher query parameters

The creator can select which results view to display, either `Data`
or `Graph` view. In the case of multiple queries in a share, the
creator can also select which query results to show first. This is
particularly useful when sharing a multi-query that involves setup
queries followed by a graph algorithm whose results are to be
displayed first.

Upon creation, the user receives a URL that can be shared with other
team members who have access to the same Lab and Memgraph instance.

##### View query share history

Users can view a history of their created query shares, including
the number of views each share has received.

The history will display all query shares created on the specific
Lab instance. If you have created query shares for multiple Memgraph
instances, such as production and staging, you will see both in the
query history. To view a query share via share link as a viewer, you
must be connected to the Memgraph instance where the share was
originally created.

Users can delete any query share from the history. Once deleted,
the URL associated with that query share will no longer be valid.

<Callout>

Note: Editing a query share is not supported. To modify a query share,
you must create a new one.

</Callout>

##### Access and view a query share

When a recipient clicks on the query share link, they must first
connect to Memgraph. All the connection details will be prefilled
on the login page, except for authentication data. Once the user
is successfully logged in, they can view the shared query and
choose to run it or save it to their collection.

Note that you cannot view a query share on a different Memgraph
instance from the one where the query share was created.

##### User definitions and permissions

For Query sharing to function correctly, users should be defined
in the Memgraph instance where the shares are created. This is
the Memgraph instance that users connect to for running queries,
not the remote storage Memgraph that Lab uses. This approach allows
tracking of who viewed each query share and enables creators to
manage their own shares.

Without user definitions in the Memgraph database, all connections
are treated as the same user (Not-Defined user). This means everyone
can see all query shares and potentially delete them from the history.
Therefore, defining users in the Memgraph instance is essential
for maintaining security and proper management of query shares.
