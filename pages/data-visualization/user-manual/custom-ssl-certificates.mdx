## Instantiating Memgraph Lab with custom SSL certificate

Memgraph Lab supports using custom SSL certificates, ensuring secure communication over HTTPS. To set up 
SSL on Memgraph Lab you will need to configure a Dockerfile using a valid SSL certificate.

### Options for generating SSL certificates

There are various options to generate SSL certificates. Check out the steps on
how to do that with [OpenSSL](#openssl) and [Let's Encrypt](#lets-encrypt). 


#### OpenSSL
[OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) is a widely used tool for
generating SSL certificates. You can create a self-signed certificate using the
following commands:

1. Generate a private key:
  ```bash
    openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
  ```

2. Generate a self-signed certificate:
  ```bash
    openssl req -new -x509 -key key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
  ```

However, this option has an expiration date and is not signed by a publicly trusted 
[certificate authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), which means 
you will most likely receive a security warning from your browser while using it.

#### Let's Encrypt
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a free, automated, and open certificate authority 
that provides SSL certificates. You can use tools like Certbot to obtain and install certificates. 
To use Let's Encrypt:

1. Install Certbot.
2. Run Certbot to obtain your certificates:
  ```bash
    sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
  ```

This will generate your SSL certificate and key, typically located in 
`/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/`.

### Dockerfile setup

To run Memgraph Lab with custom SSL certificates, you need to create a 
Dockerfile that specifies how to build the Docker image with your certificates.

You will need to set the `SSL_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_KEY_PATH` environment variables 
to override the default `./ssl/` path used by Lab running in the container to 
determine the SSL certificate location. After that, you should copy your certificates
(located in the `ssl` folder at the same location as your `Dockerfile`, for example) 
into the container at the specified path.

#### Example Dockerfile
```docker
FROM memgraph/lab:latest

# Environment variables
ENV SSL_IS_ENABLED=true
ENV SSL_CERT_PATH=./myssl/cert.pem
ENV SSL_KEY_PATH=./myssl/key.pem

# COPY source_on_your_machine destination_in_container
COPY ssl/ ./myssl/

EXPOSE 3000
```

#### Building and running the Docker container

1. **Create the SSL Directory**: Make sure your SSL certificate and key are placed 
in a directory specified as `COPY` source in your Dockerfile.

2. **Build the Docker Image**: Run the following command to build your Docker image:
   `docker build -t memgraph-lab-ssl .`

3. **Run the Docker Container**: Start the container using the following command:
   `docker run -p 3000:3000 memgraph-lab-ssl`

4. **Access Memgraph Lab**: You can now access Memgraph Lab in your web browser at 
`https://localhost:3000`. Ensure to configure your browser to trust the self-signed 
certificate if you are using one.
