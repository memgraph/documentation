# Custom query modules

Before considering developing your custom query module, numerous [graph algorithms and utility
procedures](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms) have already been
developed and are available as part of the MAGE library you can add to your
Memgraph installation. The MAGE library is included if you use Memgraph
Platform or Memgraph MAGE Docker images to run Memgraph.

You can modify them or implement custom query modules if they do not suit your needs. Memgraph supports extending
the query language with user-written procedures in **C**, **C++**, **Python**,
and **Rust**. These procedures are grouped into modules - **query module** files
(either `*.so` or `*.py` files).


# Developing your custom query module

To develop your custom query module procedures you can follow the guides for each language:

- [Python](/custom-query-modules/python)
- [C](/custom-query-modules/c)
- [C++](/custom-query-modules/cpp)
- [Rust](/custom-query-modules/rust)


Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
Python, being a dynamic language, has slower execution but offers easier writing and debugging. In contrast, modules written in C, C++, and Rust offer faster execution but are more challenging to write and debug.

Use each of the guides to ease your development process.

Every single Memgraph installation comes with the example files. For C and C++
query modules, the example files `example_c.c` and `example_cpp.cpp` are located
in `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules/src`. Corresponding shared library files,
`example_c.so` and `example_cpp.so`, based on these source files, are located in
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`.

For Python query modules, there is an `example.py` file located in the `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules/`; there is no shared library files for Python query modules since the source is interpreted at runtime.

They were provided as examples of query modules for you to examine and learn how to use them in addition to the linked guides above. 

Each query module file corresponds to one query module, and file names are
mapped as query module names. For example, `example.so` will be mapped as
`example` module, and `py_example.py` will be mapped as `py_example` module. If
each module file has a procedure called `procedure` defined, those procedures
would be mapped in the Cypher query language as `example.procedure()` and
`py_example.procedure()` respectively.

Each query module file can contain multiple read and write procedures and functions. 


# Modifying the existing query modules 

If existing MAGE library modules almost meet your needs, consider modifying them and make a contribution to Memgraph Mage library.

- Install the MAGE development environment from Docker Hub
- Build MAGE using the `docker build` command
- Build MAGE from source

Then, select a language you want to develop in. 

### Install MAGE and import query modules

<Tabs items={["Docker Hub","Docker Build","From source","MAGE x NVIDIA cuGraph"]}>

<Tab> 

        The following steps will guide you through installing MAGE development
        environment from Docker Hub and importing developed query modules.
        
        <Steps>

        {<h3>Download the MAGE image</h3>} 
        
        Run the following command to get the Memgraph and MAGE development Docker image:

        ```shell
        docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage:<version>-dev
        ```

        By running this command, you will get an image with the following tools
        installed: `Python3`, `Rust`, `Clang`, `Make`, and `CMake`.

        {<h3>Develop a query</h3>} 

        When developing with Mage, take a look at the basis of developed [algorithms and utility procedures](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) and extend based on that. 

        If you are not extending the existing query modules, you can start from scratch by following these guides or using the API docs and knowledge to develop your query modules. 

        - [Python](/custom-query-modules/python),
        - [C](/custom-query-modules/c), 
        - [C++](/custom-query-modules/cpp),
        - [Rust](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/tree/main/rust/rsmgp-example). 

        {<h3>Start the MAGE container</h3>} 

        Use the following command to start the MAGE container:

        ```shell
        docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage:version-dev
        ```

        Be sure to replace the version with the specific version, for example:

        ```shell
        docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage:1.4-dev
        ```

        {<h3>Copy the files to the container</h3>} 

        Copy the files to the container named `mage`:

        ```shell
        docker cp . mage:/mage/
        ```

        {<h3>Enter the container</h3>} 

        Position yourself inside the container as `root`:

        ```shell
        docker exec -u root -it mage /bin/bash
        ```
        <Callout> 

        If you performed the build locally, make sure to delete the `cpp/build` directory because you might be dealing with different architectures or problems with `CMakeCache.txt`. 

        To delete it, run:

        ```shell
        rm -rf cpp/build
        ```

        </Callout>

        {<h3>Build MAGE</h3>} 

        Build MAGE with the option to copy executables from `mage/dist` to `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`:

        ```shell
        python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules/
        ```

        {<h3>Exit the container</h3>} 

        Everything should be ready to exit the container and load the query modules:

        ```shell
        exit
        ```

        </Steps>

</Tab>
<Tab>

    Install MAGE with Docker Build.

    Create a Docker image directly from the [MAGE GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/memgraph/mage), instead of pulling it from the
    Docker Hub.

    <Steps>

    {<h3>Download image or clone the repo</h3>} 

    Download a [specific release](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/releases) from
    the MAGE repository or clone the [repository](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) for the latest
    version.

    ```shell
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git && cd mage
    ```
    {<h3>Build the MAGE tagged Docker image</h3>}  

    Run the following command:

    ```shell
    docker build -t memgraph-mage .
    ```

    Verify that the build is successful by starting the built image:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage
    ```

    {<h3>Develop modules</h3>} 

    When developing with Mage, take a look at the basis of developed [algorithms and utility procedures](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) and extend based on that. 

    If you are not extending the existing query modules, you can start from scratch by following these guides or using the API docs and knowledge to develop your query modules. 

    - [Python](/custom-query-modules/python),
    - [C](/custom-query-modules/c), 
    - [C++](/custom-query-modules/cpp),
    - [Rust](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/tree/main/rust/rsmgp-example). 

    {<h3>Create the `dev` image</h3>} 
    
    To create the `dev` MAGE image, run the following command:

    ```shell
    docker build --target dev -t memgraph-mage:dev .
    ```

    {<h3>Start the container</h3>}  
    
    Start the container with the following command:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage:dev
    ```

    {<h3>Copy the files to the container</h3>} 

    Copy the files to the `mage` container:

    ```shell
    docker cp . mage:/mage/
    ```

    {<h3>Enter the container</h3>} 

    Position yourself inside the container as `root`:

    ```shell
    docker exec -u root -it mage /bin/bash
    ```
    <Callout> 

    If you performed the build locally, make sure to delete the `cpp/build` directory because you might be dealing with different architectures or problems with `CMakeCache.txt`. 

    To delete it, run:

    ```shell
    rm -rf cpp/build
    ```

    </Callout>

    {<h3>Build MAGE</h3>} 

    Build MAGE with the option to copy executables from `mage/dist` to `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`:

    ```shell
    python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules/
    ```

    {<h3>Exit the container</h3>} 

    Everything should be ready to exit the container and load the query modules:

    ```shell
    exit
    ```

    </Steps>
</Tab>
<Tab>

    Follow the steps if you want to use the MAGE library with [installed Linux based
    Memgraph package](/getting-started/install-memgraph) and create custom query modules. 

    <Steps>

    {<h3>Install dependencies</h3>} 

    To build from source, you will need:
    - Python3
    - Make
    - CMake
    - Clang
    - UUID 
    - [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

    {<h3>Set up the machine</h3>} 

    Run the following commands: 

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        libcurl4        `memgraph` \
        libpython${PY_VERSION}   `memgraph` \
        libssl-dev       `memgraph` \
        openssl         `memgraph` \
        build-essential `mage-memgraph` \
        cmake           `mage-memgraph` \
        curl            `mage-memgraph` \
        g++             `mage-memgraph` \
        python3         `mage-memgraph` \
        python3-pip     `mage-memgraph` \
        python3-setuptools     `mage-memgraph` \
        python3-dev     `mage-memgraph` \
        clang           `mage-memgraph` \
        git             `mage-memgraph` \
        --no-install-recommends \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
    ```

    {<h3>Download the MAGE source code</h3>} 

    Clone the [MAGE source code](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) from GitHub:

    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git
    ```

    {<h3>Run the `setup` script</h3>} 

    Run the following command: 

    ```shell
    python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules
    ```

    The script will generate a `dist` directory with all the necessary files.

    It will also copy the contents of the newly created `dist` directory to
    `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`. Memgraph loads algorithms and modules from
    this directory. 

    If something isn't installed properly, the `setup` script will stop the
    installation process. If you have any questions, contact us on
    **[Discord](https://discord.gg/memgraph).**

    {<h5>Set a different `query_modules` directory</h5>}

    The `setup` script can set your local `mage/dist` directory or any other
    directory as the default one by changing the value of the
    `--query-modules-directory` flag in the `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`,
    Memgraph's configuration file. 

    By setting the `/mage/dist` as the default directory you don't need to copy
    `*.so` and `*.py` files from the `mage/dist` directory
    to`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` every time you run `build`:

    ```
    python3 setup modules_storage
    ```

    By setting `<your_directory>` as the default one, Memgraph will be looking for
    query modules inside `<your_directory>`, instead of `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`:

    ```
    python3 setup modules_storage -p <your_directory>
    ```

    Don't forget to copy the aforementioned files from `mage/dist` to
    `<your_directory>`.

    {<h3>Develop modules</h3>} 

    When developing with Mage, take a look at the basis of developed [algorithms and utility procedures](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) and extend based on that. 

    If you are not extending the existing query modules, you can start from scratch by following these guides or using the API docs and knowledge to develop your query modules.

    - [C++](/custom-query-modules/cpp),
    - [Rust](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/tree/main/rust/rsmgp-example). 

    {<h3>Start Memgraph</h3>} 
    
    Make sure your Memgraph instance is running:

    ```
    sudo systemctl status memgraph.service
    ```

    {<h3>Copy the query module</h3>} 
    
    Copy your developed query module to `/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` or your directory if you changed the default location of query modules:

    ```shell
    python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules
    ```

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git && cd mage
    ```

    {<h3>Build the image</h3>} 
    
    Build the *MAGE × cuGraph*-tagged Docker image:
    
    ```shell
    docker build -f Dockerfile.cugraph -t memgraph-mage .
    ```

    {<h3>Run the image</h3>} 

    Start Memgraph-MAGE with the following command:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm --gpus all -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --name mage memgraph-mage
    ```
    

    If you made any changes while the Docker container was running, you need to stop
    the container and rebuild the image.

## Querying

Query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup, so if your instance was
already running, you need to execute the following query inside one of the
querying platforms ([mgonsole](/getting-started/cli), [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization) or a [client library](/client-libraries)) to load
them:

```cypher
CALL mg.load_all();
```

Run a query and test your module. All procedures are called using the `CALL`
clause:

```cypher
MERGE (start:Node {id: 0})-[:RELATION]->(:Node {id: 1})-[:RELATION]->(:Node {id: 2})
CALL random_walk.get(start, 2) YIELD path
RETURN path
```
