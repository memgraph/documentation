# Custom query modules

Memgraph supports extending the query language with user-written procedures in
**C**, **C++**, **Python**, and **Rust**. These procedures are grouped into
modules - **query modules** files (either `*.so` or `*.py` files).

Some query modules are built-in, and others, like those that can help you solve
complex graph issues, are available as part of the MAGE library you can add to
your Memgraph installation. The library is already included if you are using
Memgraph Platform or Memgraph MAGE Docker images to run Memgraph.

You can also implement custom query modules. Every single Memgraph installation
comes with the `example.so` and `py_example.py` query modules located in the
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` directory. They were provided as examples of
query modules for you to examine and learn from.

Each query module file corresponds to one query module, and file names are
mapped as query module names. For example, `example.so` will be mapped as
`example` module, and `py_example.py` will be mapped as `py_example` module. If
each module file has a procedure called `procedure` defined, those procedures
would be mapped in the Cypher query language as `example.procedure()` and
`py_example.procedure()` respectively.

Regardless of where they come from and who wrote them, all modules need to be
loaded into Memgraph so that they can be called while querying the database.
They are either loaded automatically when Memgraph starts or manually if they
were added while Memgraph was already running. 

You can also inspect and develop query modules in Memgraph Lab (v2.0 and newer).
Just navigate to **Query Modules**.

Once you start Memgraph, it will attempt to load query modules from all *.so and
*.py files from the default directories. MAGE modules are located at
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` and custom modules developed via Memgraph Lab at
`/var/lib/memgraph/internal_modules`.

Memgraph provides public APIs for writing custom query modules in Python, C and
C++.

## Python API

Python API is defined in the `mgp` module that can be found in the Memgraph
installation directory `/usr/lib/memgraph/python_support`. In essence, it is a
wrapper around the C API. If you wish to write your own query modules using the
Python API, you need to have Python version `3.5.0` or above installed.

For more information, check the [Python API reference
guide](/custom-query-modules/python/python-api).<br/>
We also made [an example module](/custom-query-modules/python/python-example) to
help you start developing your own modules.

You can develop query modules in Python from Memgraph Lab (v2.0 and newer). Just
navigate to **Query Modules** and click on **New Module** to start.

![](/pages/custom-query-modules/memgraph_lab_query_modules.png)

Custom modules developed via Memgraph Lab are located at
`/var/lib/memgraph/internal_modules`.

[the guide on how to install
it](/custom-query-modules/manage-query-moduless).
</Callout>

### Mock Python API

The [mock Python query module API](/custom-query-modules/python/mock-python-api) enables you to
develop and test query modules for Memgraph without having to run a Memgraph
instance by simulating its behavior. As the mock API is compatible with the
[Python API](/custom-query-modules/python/python-api),
you can add modules developed with it to Memgraph as-is, without modifying the
code.

For more information and examples, check the
[mock Python API reference guide](/custom-query-modules/python/mock-python-api).

## C API

C API modules need to be compiled to a shared library so that they can be loaded
when Memgraph starts. This means that you can write the procedures in any
programming language that can work with C and be compiled to the ELF shared
library format (`.so`). `mg_procedure.h` that can be found in Memgraph
installation directory `/usr/include/memgraph` contains declarations of all
functions that can be used to implement a query module procedure. To compile the
module, you will have to pass the appropriate flags to the compiler, for
example, `clang`:

```plaintext
clang -Wall -shared -fPIC -I /usr/include/memgraph example.c -o example.so
```

For more information, check the [C API reference
guide](/custom-query-modules/c/c-api).<br/>
We also made [an example module](/custom-query-modules/c/c-example) to help you
start developing your own modules.

## C++ API

C++ API modules, just like C API modules, need to be compiled to a shared
library so that they can be loaded when Memgraph starts. This is done much in
the same way as with C API modules.

For more information, check the [C++ API reference
guide](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-api).<br/>
We also made [an example
module](/custom-query-modules/cpp/cpp-example)
to help you start developing your own modules.

## Install MAGE

You can also download a MAGE image equipped for development inside of Docker
containers:

```shell
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage:1.1-dev
```

By running this command, you will get an image with the following tools
installed: Python3, Rust, Clang, Make, and CMake. This way, you can copy files
to the container, build them inside and import query modules in Memgraph.

If you want to develop your own query modules, be sure to check the [Development
process for MAGE with
Docker](https://github.com/memgraph/mage#developing-mage-with-docker).

## This is something taken from Install MAGE that seems it's used for building custom query_modules

## This is when building MAGE from source with Linux
<Callout type="error">

Be sure you cloned the `mage` GitHub repository using the `--recurse-submodules` flag since it has incorporated Memgraph inside:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git
```

if you didn't, you can run following command to update submodules:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
</Callout>


**2.** Start Memgraph and enjoy **MAGE**!

<Callout type="error"> 
Query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup, so if your instance
was already running you will need to execute the following query inside one of
[querying platforms](/) to
load them:

```
CALL mg.load_all();
```

If your changes are not loaded, make sure to restart the instance by running
`systemctl stop memgraph` and `systemctl start memgraph`.

If you want to find out more about loading query modules, visit [this
guide](/usage/loading-modules.md).

</Callout>

### Advanced configuration

#### 1. Set a different `query_modules` directory

The `setup` script can set your local `mage/dist` directory or **any** other
directory as the **default** one in the Memgraph configuration file (flag
`--query-modules-directory` defined in `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`). There are
a few options:

**1.** Set `<your_directory>` as the **default** one:

```
python3 setup modules_storage -p <your_directory>
```

This way Memgraph will be looking for query modules inside `<your_directory>`.

<Callout type="info">

Don't forget to copy the aforementioned files from `mage/dist` to
`<your_directory>`.

</Callout>

**2.** Set `/mage/dist` as the **default** one:

```
python3 setup modules_storage
```

If the **default** directory is `mage/dist` then you don't need to copy `*.so`
and `*.py` files from the `mage/dist` directory
to`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules` every time you run `build`.

## Docker build

This way, you will create a Docker image directly from the [MAGE Github
repository](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) and won't have to pull it from
Docker Hub. You can:

- download a [specific release](https://github.com/memgraph/mage/releases) from
  the MAGE repository or
- clone the [repository](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) for the latest
  version.

If you downloaded a specific release, skip the first step.

## Installing MAGE

**1.** Download the MAGE source code from
**[GitHub](https://github.com/memgraph/mage)**:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git && cd mage
```

**2.** Build the **MAGE** tagged Docker image with the following command:

```shell
docker build -t memgraph-mage .
```

**3.** Start Memgraph-MAGE with the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage
```

<Callout type="info">

Now you can query Memgraph with any of the querying platforms like [Memgraph
Lab](https://memgraph.com/product/lab) or
[mgconsole](https://github.com/memgraph/mgconsole).

If you made any changes while the **MAGE** Docker container was running, you
would need to stop the Docker container and rebuild the whole image. If you
don't want to repeat these steps each time, be sure to check the [Development
process for MAGE with
Docker](https://github.com/memgraph/mage#developing-mage-with-docker).

</Callout>

## Developing MAGE with Docker

When developing your query module, you need to load it inside Memgraph running
inside the Docker container. You can do that by [rebuilding the whole MAGE
image](#1-rebuild-the-whole-mage-image) or by [building it inside the Docker
container](#2-build-inside-the-docker-container).

### 1. Rebuild the whole MAGE image

This command will trigger the rebuild of the whole Docker image. Make sure that
you have added Python requirements inside `python/requirements.txt` file.

**1.** Firstly, do the build of the **MAGE** image:

```
docker build -t memgraph-mage .
```

**2.** Now, start `memgraph-mage` image with the following command and enjoy
**your** own **MAGE**:

```
docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage
```

### 2. Build inside the Docker container

You can build a **MAGE** Docker image equipped for development. `Rust`, `Clang`,
`Python3-pip`, and everything else necessary for development will still be
inside the running container. This means that you can copy the **MAGE**
repository to the container and do the build inside the `mage` container. There
is no need to do the whole Docker image build again.

**1.** To create `dev` **MAGE** image, run the following command:

```
docker build --target dev -t memgraph-mage:dev .
```

**2.** Then run the image with the following command:

```
docker run --rm -p 7687:7687 --name mage memgraph-mage:dev
```

**3.** Next, copy the files inside the container and do the build:

**a)** First, you need to copy the files to the container named `mage`

```
docker cp . mage:/mage/
```

**b)** Then, you need to position yourself inside the container as root:

```
docker exec -u root -it mage /bin/bash
```

<Callout type="info">

Note: If you have done the build locally, make sure to delete the directory
`cpp/build` because you might be dealing with different `architectures` or
problems with `CMakeCache.txt`. To delete it, run:

`rm -rf cpp/build`

</Callout>

**c)** After that, run build and copy `mage/dist` to
`/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules`:

```
python3 setup build -p /usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules/
```

**d)** Everything should be ready, and you can run the following command to exit
the container:

```
exit
```

<Callout type="info">

Note that query modules are loaded into Memgraph on startup, so if your instance
was already running, you would need to execute the following query inside one of
the [querying platforms](/)
to load them:

`CALL mg.load_all();`

</Callout>

## Memgraph X cuGraph

<Callout type="info">

The development image with cuGraph support is not available yet. If you want to
develop cuGraph-powered query modules in Docker, do not hesitate to [contact
us](https://memgraph.com/community) about it.

</Callout>

### Building MAGE with NVIDIA cuGraph locally with Docker

1.  Download the MAGE source code from
    [GitHub](https://github.com/memgraph/mage):

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/memgraph/mage.git && cd mage
    ```

2.  Build the **MAGE × cuGraph**-tagged Docker image:

    ```shell
    docker build -f Dockerfile.cugraph -t memgraph-mage .
    ```

3.  Start Memgraph-MAGE with the following command:
    ```shell
    docker run --rm --gpus all -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --name mage memgraph-mage
    ```

<Callout type="info">

You can now query Memgraph from querying platforms such as [Memgraph
Lab](https://memgraph.com/product/lab) or
[mgconsole](https://github.com/memgraph/mgconsole).

If you made any changes while the Docker container was running, you need to stop
the container and rebuild the image. For a workaround, check [Development
process for MAGE with
Docker](/installation/docker-build.md#developing-mage-with-docker).
