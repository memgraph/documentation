# Import data from CSV files

If your data is in CSV format, you can import it into a running Memgraph
database from designated CSV files using the [`LOAD CSV` Cypher
clause](#load-csv-cypher-clause) or directly from [Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization) using a [CSV file
import](#csv-file-import-in-memgraph-lab) method.

<Callout>

If the data imports slower than expected, you can [speed up the
import](#increase-import-speed) by creating indexes on nodes to improve the
import speed of relationships or switching the [storage
mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#storage-modes) to analytical.

If the import speed remains unsatisfactory, don't hesitate to reach out on
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/memgraph).

</Callout>

## `LOAD CSV` Cypher clause

The `LOAD CSV` clause reads row by row from a CSV file, binds the contents of the
parsed row to the specified variable, and populates the database if it is empty,
or appends new data to an existing dataset. Memgraph supports the Excel CSV
dialect, as it's the most common one.

### `LOAD CSV` clause syntax

<Callout type="info">

Memgraph Cloud instances do not have direct access to files stored on a user's
local machine or private network. To use `LOAD CSV` within Memgraph Cloud,
upload your CSV file to a public URL and import data directly from there.

Here is an example of the Cypher query:

```cypher
LOAD CSV FROM "https://example.com/path/to/your-data.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
```

</Callout>

The syntax of the `LOAD CSV` clause is:

```cypher
LOAD CSV FROM <csv-location> ( WITH | NO ) HEADER [IGNORE BAD] [DELIMITER <delimiter-string>] [QUOTE <quote-string>] [NULLIF <nullif-string>] AS <variable-name>
```

- `<csv-location>` is a string of the location of the CSV file.<br/> Without a
  URL protocol, it refers to a file path. There are no restrictions on where in
  your file system the file can be located, as long as the path is valid (i.e.,
  the file exists). If you are using Docker to run Memgraph, you will need to
  [copy the files from your local directory into
  Docker](/getting-started/first-steps-with-docker#copy-files-from-and-to-a-docker-container)
  container where Memgraph can access them. <br/> If using `http://`,
  `https://`, or `ftp://` the CSV file will be fetched over the network.

- `( WITH | NO ) HEADER` flag specifies whether the CSV file has a header, in
  which case it will be parsed as a map, or it doesn't have a header, in which
  case it will be parsed as a list.

  If the **`WITH HEADER`** option is set, the very first line in the file will be
  parsed as the header, and any remaining rows will be parsed as regular rows. The
  value bound to the row variable will be a map of the form:

  ```plaintext
  { ( "header_field" : "row_value" )? ( , "header_field" : "row_value" )* }
  ```

  If the **`NO HEADER`** option is set, then each row is parsed as a list of values.
  The contents of the row can be accessed using the list index syntax. Note that
  in this mode, there are no restrictions on the number of values a row contains.
  This isn't recommended, as the user must manually handle the varying number of
  values in a row.

* `IGNORE BAD` flag specifies whether rows containing errors should be ignored
  or not. If it's set, the parser attempts to return the first valid row from
  the CSV file. If it isn't set, an exception will be thrown on the first
  invalid row encountered.

* `DELIMITER <delimiter-string>` option enables the user to specify the CSV
  delimiter character. If it isn't set, the default delimiter character `,` is
  assumed.

* `QUOTE <quote-string>` option enables the user to specify the CSV quote
  character. If it isn't set, the default quote character `"` is assumed.

* `NULLIF <nullif-string>` option enables you to specify a sequence of
  characters that will be parsed as null. By default, all empty columns in
  Memgraph are treated as empty strings, so if this option is not used, no
  values will be treated as null.

* `<variable-name>` is a symbolic name representing the variable to which the
  contents of the parsed row will be bound to, enabling access to the row
  contents later in the query. The variable doesn't have to be used in any
  subsequent clause.

### `LOAD CSV` clause specificities

When using the `LOAD CSV` clause please keep in mind:

- **The parser parses the values as strings** so it's up to the user to convert
  the parsed row values to the appropriate type. This can be done using the
  built-in conversion functions such as `ToInteger`, `ToFloat`, `ToBoolean` etc.
  Consult the documentation on [the available conversion
  functions](/querying/functions).

  If all values are indeed strings and the file has a header, you can import
  data using the following query:

  ```cypher
  LOAD CSV FROM "/people.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
  CREATE (p:People) SET p += row;
  ```

- **The `LOAD CSV` clause is not a standalone clause**,  meaning a valid query
  must contain at least one more clause, for example:

  ```cypher
  LOAD CSV FROM "/people.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
  CREATE (p:People) SET p += row;
  ```

  In this regard, the following query will throw an exception:

  ```cypher
  LOAD CSV FROM "/file.csv" WITH HEADER AS row;
  ```

  **Adding a `MATCH` or `MERGE` clause before LOAD CSV** allows you to match certain
  entities in the graph before running LOAD CSV, optimizing the process as
  matched entities do not need to be searched for every row in the CSV file.  

  But, the `MATCH` or `MERGE` clause can be used prior the `LOAD CSV` clause only
  if the clause returns only one row. Returning multiple rows before calling the
  `LOAD CSV` clause will cause a Memgraph runtime error.

- **The `LOAD CSV` clause can be used at most once per query**, so queries like
  the one below will throw an exception:

  ```cypher
  LOAD CSV FROM "/x.csv" WITH HEADER as x
  LOAD CSV FROM "/y.csv" WITH HEADER as y
  CREATE (n:A {p1 : x, p2 : y});
  ```

### Increase import speed

The `LOAD CSV` clause will create relationships much faster and consequently
speed up data import if you [create indexes](/fundamentals/indexes) on nodes or
node properties once you import them:

```cypher
  CREATE INDEX ON :Node(id);
```

If the LOAD CSV clause is merging data instead of creating it, create indexes
before running the LOAD CSV clause.

You can also speed up import if you switch Memgraph to [**analytical storage
mode**](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#storage-modes). In the analytical
storage mode there are no ACID guarantees besides manually created snapshots but
it does **increase the import speed up to 6 times with 6 times less memory
consumption**. After import you can switch the storage mode back to
transactional and enable ACID guarantees.

You can switch between modes within the session using the following query:

```cypher
STORAGE MODE IN_MEMORY_{TRANSACTIONAL|ANALYTICAL};
```

If you use `IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL` mode and have nodes and relationships stored in
 separate CSV files, you can run multiple concurrent `LOAD CSV` queries to import data even faster.
In order to achieve the best import performance, split your nodes and edge
files into smaller files and run multiple `LOAD CSV` queries in parallel. 
The key is to run all `LOAD CSV` queries for nodes first. After that, run 
all relationship `LOAD CSV` queries. 

Read more about this in [import best pratices](TBD) 

The `LOAD CSV` clause can handle CSVs that are compressed with `gzip` or `bzip2`. This
can speed up the time it takes to fetch and/or load the file.

If you are using on-disk storage mode, consider using [Edge import
mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#import-data-using-load-csv-command) to
get the best import performance.

### Import files WITH and NO HEADER

The goal of this example is to import two CSV files.

One file contains data we will use to create nodes labeled `:Person`, and the
other file will be used to connect those nodes with the `:IS_FRIENDS_WITH` relationship.

There are also two variations of the files: files with a header and files without a header.

  {<h3>Check the location of the CSV files</h3>}
  If you are working with Docker, [copy the files from your local directory into
  the Docker container](/getting-started/first-steps-with-docker#copy-files-from-and-to-a-docker-container)
  so that Memgraph can access them.

  {<h3>Import nodes</h3>}

<Tabs items={['CSV files with a header', 'CSV files without a header']}>

  <Tab>

    These CSV files have a header, which means the `HEADER` option of the `LOAD CSV` clause needs
    to be set to `WITH`. Each row will be parsed as a map, and the fields can be accessed using the
    property lookup syntax (e.g. `id:row.id`).

    The following query will load row by row from the `people_nodes_wh` CSV file, and create a
    new node for each row with properties based on the parsed row values:

    ```cypher
    LOAD CSV FROM "/path-to/people_nodes_wh.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
    CREATE (p:Person {id: row.id, name: row.name});
    ```

    If successful, you should receive an `Empty set (0.014 sec)` message.

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    These CSV files don't have a header, so the `HEADER` option of the `LOAD CSV`
    needs to be set to `NO`. Each row will be parsed as a list, and you can access
    elements by defining the position of the element in the list.

    The following query will load row by row from the `people_nodes_nh` CSV file, and
    create a new node for each row with properties based on the parsed row values:

    ```cypher
    LOAD CSV FROM "/path-to/people_nodes.csv" NO HEADER AS row
    CREATE (p:Person {id: row[0], name: row[1]});
    ```

    If successful, you should receive an `Empty set (0.014 sec)` message.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  {<h3>Create indexes</h3>} 
  
    Creating an [index](/fundamentals/indexes) on a
    property used to connect nodes with relationships, in this case, the `id`
    property of the `:Person` nodes, will speed up the import of relationships,
    especially with large datasets:

    ```cypher
    CREATE INDEX ON :Person(id);
    ```

  {<h3>Import relationships</h3>}

<Tabs items={['CSV files with a header', 'CSV files without a header']}>

### Import data from a single CSV file containing both nodes and relationships

This example will show how to use set of Cypher queries to import data into
Memgraph from a single CSV file containing both nodes and relationships. This
file has header row.

The `people_friendship.csv` file is structured to contain both people and their relationships:

  - `type`: Indicates the type of record. It has two possible values: `PERSON` for individual records and `IS_FRIEND` for relationships.
  - `id`: Unique identifier for a person. This is filled only for `PERSON` records.
  - `name`: Name of the person. This is also filled only for `PERSON` records.
  - `id_from` and `id_to`: Used to denote relationships. For `IS_FRIEND` records, `id_from` is the ID of the person from whom the friendship originates, and `id_to` is the ID of the friend.

This structure allows representation of both nodes (persons) and their relationships (friendships) within a single CSV file.

<Steps>

 {<h3>Download the file</h3>}

- [`people_friendship.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/all-data-one-file/people_friendship.csv). The file contains the following data:

```csv
type,id,name,id_from,id_to
PERSON,100,Daniel,,
PERSON,101,Alex,,
PERSON,102,Sarah,,
PERSON,103,Mia,,
PERSON,104,Lucy,,
IS_FRIEND,,,100,101
IS_FRIEND,,,100,102
IS_FRIEND,,,100,103
IS_FRIEND,,,101,103
IS_FRIEND,,,102,104
```

{<h3>Import nodes</h3>}

First, import the individual records (people) from the CSV file. Only rows with non-empty `id` and `name` columns are processed.

```cypher
LOAD CSV FROM "/path-to/people_friendship.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
WITH row WHERE row.type = 'PERSON'
CREATE (:Person {id: row.id, name: row.name});
```

{<h3>Create indexes</h3>}
Create an index on the `id` property of `:Person` nodes to enhance the performance of the relationship import process.

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(id);
```

{<h3>Import relationships</h3>}
Finally, import the relationships from the CSV file, focusing on rows where `id_from` and `id_to` are not empty.

```cypher
LOAD CSV FROM "/path-to/people_friendship.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
WITH row WHERE row.type = 'IS_FRIEND'
MATCH (p1:Person {id: row.id_from}), (p2:Person {id: row.id_to})
CREATE (p1)-[:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2);
```

  {<h3>Final result</h3>}
  Run the following query to see how the imported data looks as a graph:

  ```
  MATCH p=()-[]-() RETURN p;
  ```
  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/load_csv_one_file_for_nodes_and_relationships.png)

</Steps>

### Import multiple CSV files with distinct graph objects

In this example, the data is split across four files, each file contains nodes
of a single label or relationships of a single type. All files have a header.

<Steps>

  {<h3>Download the files</h3>}

  - [`people_nodes.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/multiple-types-nodes/people_nodes.csv) is used to create nodes labeled `:Person`.<br/> The file contains the following data:
    ```csv
    id,name,age,city
    100,Daniel,30,London
    101,Alex,15,Paris
    102,Sarah,17,London
    103,Mia,25,Zagreb
    104,Lucy,21,Paris
    ```
- [`restaurants_nodes.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/multiple-types-nodes/restaurants_nodes.csv) is used to create nodes labeled `:Restaurants`.<br/> The file contains the following data:
    ```csv
    id,name,menu
    200,Mc Donalds,Fries;BigMac;McChicken;Apple Pie
    201,KFC,Fried Chicken;Fries;Chicken Bucket
    202,Subway,Ham Sandwich;Turkey Sandwich;Foot-long
    203,Dominos,Pepperoni Pizza;Double Dish Pizza;Cheese filled Crust
    ```

- [`people_relationships.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/multiple-types-nodes/people_relationships.csv) is used to connect people with the `:IS_FRIENDS_WITH` relationship.<br/> The file contains the following data:
    ```csv
    first_person,second_person,met_in
    100,102,2014
    103,101,2021
    102,103,2005
    101,104,2005
    104,100,2018
    101,102,2017
    100,103,2001
    ```
-  [`restaurants_relationships.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/multiple-types-nodes/restaurants_relationships.csv) is used to connect people with restaurants using the `:ATE_AT` relationship.<br/> The file contains the following data:
    ```csv
    PERSON_ID,REST_ID,liked
    100,200,true
    103,201,false
    104,200,true
    101,202,false
    101,203,false
    101,200,true
    102,201,true
    ```

  {<h3>Check the location of the CSV files</h3>}
  If you are working with Docker, [copy the files from your local directory into
  the Docker container](/getting-started/first-steps-with-docker#copy-files-from-and-to-a-docker-container)
  so that Memgraph can access them.

  {<h3>Import nodes</h3>}

  The CSV files have a header, which means the `HEADER` option of the `LOAD CSV`
  clause needs to be set to `WITH`. Each row will be parsed as a map, and the
  fields can be accessed using the property lookup syntax (e.g. `id: row.id`).

  The following query will load row by row from the file, and create a new node
  for each row with properties based on the parsed row values:

      ```cypher
      LOAD CSV FROM "/path-to/people_nodes.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
      CREATE (n:Person {id: row.id, name: row.name, age: ToInteger(row.age), city: row.city});
      ```

  In the same manner, the following query will create new nodes for each restaurant:

      ```cypher
      LOAD CSV FROM "/path-to/restaurants_nodes.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
      CREATE (n:Restaurant {id: row.id, name: row.name, menu: row.menu});
      ```

  {<h3>Create indexes</h3>}

  Creating an [index](/fundamentals/indexes) on a property used to connect nodes
  with relationships, in this case, the `id` property of the `:Person` nodes,
  will speed up the import of relationships, especially with large datasets:

      ```cypher
      CREATE INDEX ON :Person(id);
      ```

  {<h3>Import relationships</h3>}
  The following query will create relationships between the people nodes:

  ```cypher
  LOAD CSV FROM "/path-to/people_relationships.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
  MATCH (p1:Person {id: row.first_person})
  MATCH (p2:Person {id: row.second_person})
  CREATE (p1)-[f:IS_FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2)
  SET f.met_in = row.met_in;
  ```

  The following query will create relationships between people and restaurants where they ate:

  ```cypher
  LOAD CSV FROM "/path-to/restaurants_relationships.csv" WITH HEADER AS row
  MATCH (p1:Person {id: row.PERSON_ID})
  MATCH (re:Restaurant {id: row.REST_ID})
  CREATE (p1)-[ate:ATE_AT]->(re)
  SET ate.liked = ToBoolean(row.liked);
  ```

  {<h3>Final result</h3>}
  Run the following query to see how the imported data looks as a graph:

  ```
  MATCH p=()-[]-() RETURN p;
  ```

</Steps>

## CSV file import in Memgraph Lab

The CSV file import tool reads row by row from loaded CSV files, each containing
separate data for a specific node label or a relationship type. It binds the
contents of the parsed row to the specified variable and either merges the data
with the current dataset or drops the database and starts from scratch,
depending on the user's choice.
<Callout>

The CSV file import tool is convenient for importing smaller amounts of data. 
However, for larger datasets, it is still recommended to use [LOAD CSV](#load-csv-cypher-clause) 
as the best practice for importing.

</Callout>

### Import files WITH and NO HEADER

The goal of this example is to import two CSV files.

One file contains data we will use to create nodes labeled `:Person` and the
other file will be used to connect those nodes with the `:IS_FRIENDS_WITH` 
relationship.



There are also two variations of the files, files with a header and files 
without a header.

  {<h3>Upload files</h3>}
  Upload your files by selecting them from your local filesystem or using a drag 
  and drop method. Once all your files are uploaded, proceed to configure each 
  one separately. 
  
  Let's start by configuring the nodes by clicking on the `people_nodes.csv` file.

  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/file_upload.png)
  
  {<h3>Configure nodes</h3>}

  <Tabs items={['CSV files with a header', 'CSV files without a header']}>

    <Tab>
      After clicking on the `+ Add node` button for our CSV file with a header, 
      make sure you select the checkbox on the left side of the interface 
      indicating that the file has a header row. Just below that checkbox, the 
      preview of the detected properties and the first row of your file will be 
      displayed.

      During configuration, start by adding a **Node label** and choose whether 
      to include an index with the label. 

      <Callout>

      Index data carefully as indexes do speed up queries but also take up memory.

      </Callout>

      Let's add the label `:Person` and leave the index checkbox empty since we 
      currently only have one type of node and using an index won't impact 
      performance.

      Next, add properties. In the dropdown, you can choose from the properties 
      identified by the import tool from the header of the file. Select the ones 
      you need and customize each property by renaming it, defining the type and 
      specifying whether it should be `Unique`, `Required` or `Indexed`. 

      Finally, choose how to handle duplicates: `Import everything`, `Merge` or 
      `Skip`. 

      The image below illustrates a possible configuration: 
      - Since nodes are identified by the `id` property, the selected checkboxes 
      indicate uniqueness, requirement, and indexing of that property. 
      - For the configuration of the `name` property, not all nodes need unique 
      names, but having that property is necessary, so the required checkbox is 
      marked.

    </Tab>
    <Tab>

      After clicking on the `+ Add node` button for our CSV file without a header, 
      make sure you unselect the checkbox on the left side of the interface 
      indicating that the file has a header row. Just below that checkbox, the 
      preview of the first row of your file by columns will be displayed.

      During configuration, start by adding a **Node label** and choose whether 
      to include an index with the label. 
      
      <Callout>

      Index data carefully as indexes do speed up queries but also take up memory.

      </Callout>

      Let's add the label `:Person` and leave the index checkbox empty since we 
      currently only have one type of node and using an index won't impact 
      performance.

      Next, add properties. In the dropdown, you can choose columns identified 
      by the import tool along with the previews of the first row for easier 
      managing. Select the ones you need and customize each property by renaming 
      it, defining the type and specifying whether it should be `Unique`, 
      `Required` or `Indexed`. 

      Finally, choose how to handle duplicates: `Import everything`, `Merge` or 
      `Skip`. 

      The image below illustrates a possible configuration: 
      - Since nodes are identified by the `id` property, the selected checkboxes 
      indicate uniqueness, requirement, and indexing of that property. 
      - For the configuration of the `name` property, not all nodes need unique 
      names, but having that property is necessary, so the required checkbox is 
      marked.

  {<h3>Configure relationships</h3>}

  Let's now start with configuring the relationships by clicking on the 
  `people_relationships.csv` file.

  <Tabs items={['CSV files with a header', 'CSV files without a header']}>

    <Tab>

      After clicking on the `+ Add edge` button for our CSV file with a header, 
      make sure you select the checkbox on the left side of the interface 
      indicating that the file has a header row. Again, the preview of the 
      detected properties and the first row of your file will be displayed.

      During configuration, start by adding an **Edge type**, in our case 
      `IS_FRIENDS_WITH`. 

      Moving on, let's add the **Node labels** for both the starting and ending 
      nodes of the relationship. Since all our nodes have the label `:Person`, 
      we'll select the `:Person` label for both.
      It's important to understand the schema of your data at this point to 
      choose the appropriate labels.

      After selecting labels, add the extra property condition that specifies 
      which node property corresponds to the selected property from the CSV file 
      containing relationships.

      There's an option to add edge properties, but since our relationships 
      don't have any properties, we can skip that step.

      Once again, finalize your configuration by choosing how to handle 
      duplicates: `Import everything`, `Merge` or `Skip`.

      columns and values of the first row of your file will be displayed.

      During configuration, start by adding an Edge type, in our case 
      `IS_FRIENDS_WITH`. 

      Moving on, let's add the Node labels for both the starting and ending 
      nodes of the relationship. Since all our nodes have the label `:Person`, 
      we'll select the `:Person` label for both.
      It's important to understand the schema of your data at this point to

  {<h3>Import data</h3>}

  Once you've configured your files, Memgraph proceeds through four steps to 
  import data:

  1. **Validating files**: Ensuring the consistency of data format across all CSV files.
  2. **Uploading to Memgraph**: Uploading files to prepare them for validation.
  3. **Import progress**: Setting up the database, creating constraints 
  (selected in the configuration, such as uniqueness and existence), establishing 
  indexes and importing nodes and relationships.
  4. **Database cleanup**: Removing the files from Memgraph.

  The import process is complete! The data has been successfully imported into 
  Memgraph and now it's time to head over to the `Query execution` window to 
  explore your dataset and execute queries.

  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/import_successful.png)

  {<h3>Final result</h3>}
  Run the following query to see how the imported data looks as a graph:

### Import data from a single CSV file

In this example, we'll use the same data from the previous section, but imported
from the same CSV file. 

<Steps>

  {<h3>Download the file</h3>}

  - [`nodes_and_relationships.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/import-tool-single/nodes_and_relationships.csv) 
  is used to create nodes and relationships.
  
  The file contains four columns, two containing properties `id` and `name` for 
  nodes labeled with `:Person` and two containing `id` property of nodes the
  relationship `:IS_FRIENDS_WITH` is connecting.  
  
  <br/> 

  {<h3>Configure nodes</h3>}

  After uploading the file, we need to configure it. 
  
  Let's start by configuring nodes. Select the `+ Add node` button and assign 
  the label `:Person` to the nodes. After adding the label, choose properties 
  from the dropdown from the CSV related to the nodes, in this case, `id` and 
  `name`.
  
  The image below illustrates a possible configuration:
  
  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/single_people_nodes.png)

  <br/>

  - Since `id` is the key property for identifying nodes, it needs to be 
  unique, required and optionally indexed. 
  - The `name` property is a string property required for a node, but not 
  every node needs to have a unique name property.

  Finally, choose how to handle duplicates: `Import everything`, `Merge` or `Skip`.

  <br/>

  {<h3>Configure relationships</h3>}

  Let's now configure edges connecting the nodes, with relationship type
  `IS_FRIENDS_WITH`.

  After selecting `+ Add Edge`, assign the `IS_FRIENDS_WITH` relationship type. 
  We now need to choose the **Start node** and the **End node** label. 
  Since relationship type `IS_FRIENDS_WITH` only connects nodes with `:Person` 
  label, both our `Start node` label and `End node` label is going to be 
  `:Person`.

  Select the properties from the CSV file that corresponds to the id of the person
  relationship is connecting and add edge properties if they exists. 
  
  The image below illustrates a possible configuration:
  
  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/single_people_relationships.png)

  Finally, choose how to handle duplicates: `Import everything`, `Merge` or `Skip`.

  <br/>

  {<h3>Final result</h3>}

  After configuring files and successfully importing data into Memgraph, 
  navigate to the **Query execution** window and execute the following query to 
  visualize the imported data as a graph:

  ```
  MATCH p=()-[]-() RETURN p;
  ```

### Import data from multiple CSV files

In this example, the same data from the previous example is split across four 
files, each file containing nodes of a single label or relationships of a single 
type. All files have a header.

<Steps>

  {<h3>Download the files</h3>}

  - [`people_nodes.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/multiple-types-nodes/people_nodes.csv) is used to create nodes labeled `:Person`.<br/> The file contains the following data:
    ```csv
    id,name,age,city
    100,Daniel,30,London
    101,Alex,15,Paris
    102,Sarah,17,London
    103,Mia,25,Zagreb
    104,Lucy,21,Paris
    ```
- [`restaurants_nodes.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/multiple-types-nodes/restaurants_nodes.csv) is used to create nodes labeled `:Restaurants`.<br/> The file contains the following data:
    ```csv
    id,name,menu
    200,Mc Donalds,Fries;BigMac;McChicken;Apple Pie
    201,KFC,Fried Chicken;Fries;Chicken Bucket
    202,Subway,Ham Sandwich;Turkey Sandwich;Foot-long
    203,Dominos,Pepperoni Pizza;Double Dish Pizza;Cheese filled Crust
    ```

- [`people_relationships.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/multiple-types-nodes/people_relationships.csv) is used to connect people with the `:IS_FRIENDS_WITH` relationship.<br/> The file contains the following data:
    ```csv
    first_person,second_person,met_in
    100,102,2014
    103,101,2021
    102,103,2005
    101,104,2005
    104,100,2018
    101,102,2017
    100,103,2001
    ```
-  [`restaurants_relationships.csv`](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/load-csv-cypher/multiple-types-nodes/restaurants_relationships.csv) is used to connect people with restaurants using the `:ATE_AT` relationship.<br/> The file contains the following data:
    ```csv
    PERSON_ID,REST_ID,liked
    100,200,true
    103,201,false
    104,200,true
    101,202,false
    101,203,false
    101,200,true
    102,201,true
    ```

  {<h3>Data schema</h3>}
  
  When configuring files, it's important to understand the schema of the data 
  being imported.

  The image below illustrates the structure of the data schema: 

  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/data_schema.png)

  {<h3>Configure nodes</h3>}

  After uploading all four files in the import window, we need to configure each 
  one individually. Let's start by configuring the files containing nodes, 
  `people_nodes.csv` and `restaurants_nodes.csv`.

  For the **`people_nodes.csv`** file, we'll assign the `:People` label. Since we 
  now have more than one type of node labels, we'll add an index to enhance the 
  query speed.

  Next, let's add properties. In the dropdown, select all available properties: 
  `id`, `name`, `age` and `city`. 
  
  The image below illustrates a possible configuration:
  
  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/multiple_people_nodes.png)

  <br/>

  - Since `id` is the key property for identifying nodes, it needs to be unique, 
  required and optionally indexed. 
  - The `name` property is a string property 
  required for a node, but not every node needs to have a unique name property.
  - The `age` property is an optional integer property that neither has to exist 
  nor be unique.
  - The `city` is an optional string property that neither has to exist nor be 
  unique as well.

  Finally, choose how to handle duplicates: `Import everything`, `Merge` or `Skip`.



  For the **`restaurant_nodes.csv`** file, we'll assign the `:Restaurants` label and 
  again add an index to the label.

  Next, let's add properties. In the dropdown, select all available properties: 
  `id`, `name` and `menu`. 
  
  The image below illustrates a possible configuration:
  
  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/multiple_restaurant_nodes.png)

  <br/>

  - Since `id` is the key property for identifying nodes, it needs to be unique, 
  required and optionally indexed. 
  - The `name` property is a string property required for a node, but not every 
  node needs to have a unique name property.
  - The `menu` is an optional string property that neither has to exist nor be 
  unique.

  Finally, choose how to handle duplicates: `Import everything`, `Merge` or `Skip`.

  <br/>

  {<h3>Configure relationships</h3>}

  Let's now configure the files containing relationships, `people_relationships.csv` 
  and `restaurants_relationships.csv`.

  For the **`people_relationships.csv`** file, we'll assign the `IS_FRIENDS_WITH` 
  relationship type. We also need to choose the **Start node** and the 
  **End node** label. 
  For this step, it's important to know the schema of the data. Since 
  relationship type `IS_FRIENDS_WITH` only connects nodes with `:People` label, 
  both our `Start node` label and `End node` label is going to be `:People`.

  Next, let's add properties. In the dropdown, select the property `met_in`. 
  
  The image below illustrates a possible configuration:
  
  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/multiple_people_relationships.png)

  <br/>

  Finally, choose how to handle duplicates: `Import everything`, `Merge` or `Skip`.


  For the **`restaurants_relationships.csv`** file, we'll assign the `ATE_AT` 
  relationship type. We also need to choose the **Start node** and the **End node** 
  label. From our data schema, relationship type `ATE_AT` connects nodes with 
  `:People` label to nodes with `:Restaurants` label. 

  Next, let's add properties. In the dropdown, select the property `liked`. 
  Since values of that property are either `true` or `false`, the type of the 
  property can be defined as boolean.
  
  The image below illustrates a possible configuration:
  
  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/multiple_restaurants_relationships.png)

  Finally, choose how to handle duplicates: `Import everything`, `Merge` or `Skip`.

  <br/>

  {<h3>Final result</h3>}

  After configuring files and successfully importing data into Memgraph, 
  navigate to the Query execution window and execute the following query to 
  visualize the imported data as a graph:

  ```
  MATCH p=()-[]-() RETURN p;
  ```

  ![](/pages/data-migration/csv/graph_illustration_1.png)
