# Overview of Supported Data Sources

Memgraph supports multiple data sources for importing data into a running instance. Whether your data is structured in files, 
relational databases, or other graph databases, Memgraph provides the flexibility to integrate and analyze your data efficiently.

Memgraph supports file system imports like CSV files, offering efficient and structured data ingestion. **However,
if you want to migrate directly from another database, you can use the
[`migrate` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/migrate)** from Memgraph MAGE for a direct transition
without the need to convert your data into intermediate files.

[import best practices](/data-migration/best-practices).**

## File Types

### CSV Files

CSV files provide a simple and efficient way to import tabular data into Memgraph 
using the [LOAD CSV clause](/querying/clauses/load-csv). 

Using the [LOAD CSV import guide](/data-migration/csv), 
you can implement your own CSV import through Memgraph LAB, or a simple database driver.


### JSON Files

Memgraph supports importing data from JSON files, allowing structured and semi-structured data to be 
efficiently loaded, using the [`json_util` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/json_util) 
and [`import_util` module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/import_util).

Check out the [JSON import guide](/data-migration/json).

### Cypherl File
Cypherl file is a simple format which defines a cypher command per line. It is usually divided in 2 parts:
- `CREATE` statements for nodes, followed by 
- `MATCH`, `MATCH` + `CREATE` statements for relationships

An example for node creation in Cypherl would be similar to this query:
```cypher
CREATE (:Person {id: 1, name: "John", age: 18});
CREATE (:Person {id: 2, name: "Mark", age: 25});
```

While the example for relationship creation in Cypherl would be similar to this query:
```cypher
MATCH (p1:Person {id: 1}) MATCH (p2:Person {id: 2}) CREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS]->(p2);
```

If you have existing Cypherl files defining your graph structure, Memgraph can execute them directly to
populate your database. See the [Cypherl import guide](/data-migration/cypherl).

## Relational Databases

### MySQL

Memgraph can integrate with MySQL databases, enabling seamless migration and real-time synchronization. Learn more about [MySQL data import](#).

### SQL Server

For enterprises using Microsoft SQL Server, Memgraph supports data import using ETL processes or direct queries. Read the [SQL Server import documentation](#).

### OracleDB

Memgraph can extract and import data from OracleDB, leveraging SQL queries or external connectors. Find more details in the [OracleDB import guide](#).

## Graph Databases

### Neo4j

If you're transitioning from Neo4j to Memgraph, you can use [`neo4j-admin dump`](#) or Cypher queries to migrate your data. See the [Neo4j import guide](#).

## Streaming Sources

### Apache Kafka

For real-time data ingestion, Memgraph supports Apache Kafka as a streaming data source. Learn how to set up a [Kafka stream](#) with Memgraph.

### Apache Spark

For large-scale data processing, Memgraph can ingest data from Apache Spark using Spark connectors. See the [Apache Spark integration](#).

### Dremio

Dremio users can integrate their datasets with Memgraph using REST APIs or SQL-based queries. Check out the [Dremio data import guide](#).
