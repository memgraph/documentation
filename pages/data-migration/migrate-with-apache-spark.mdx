# High-Speed Graph Ingestion with Memgraph and Apache Spark

This guide demonstrates how to efficiently ingest 2 million edges into Memgraph within 3 seconds using Apache Spark. 
The script leverages Memgraph's **IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL** mode for multithreading, **DROP GRAPH** for instant dataset 
clearing, and **indexing** to optimize relationship insertions. Below, we break down the key components of the script and explain their importance.

## Prerequisites
- Memgraph installed and running
- Apache Spark configured (using PySpark)
- this guide uses GQLAlchemy to query Memgraph with Python
- CSV files containing node and relationship data

### Compatibility Table

When using Apache Spark with Memgraph, ensure that you use the correct Neo4j Spark Connector version based on 
your Spark and Scala versions. Below is a compatibility table:

| Spark Version | Artifact (Scala 2.12) | Artifact (Scala 2.13) |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **3.3** | `org.neo4j:neo4j-connector-apache-spark_2.12:5.1.0_for_spark_3` | `org.neo4j:neo4j-connector-apache-spark_2.13:5.1.0_for_spark_3` |
| **3.2** | `org.neo4j:neo4j-connector-apache-spark_2.12:5.0.3_for_spark_3` | `org.neo4j:neo4j-connector-apache-spark_2.13:5.0.3_for_spark_3` |
| **3.0 and 3.1** | `org.neo4j:neo4j-connector-apache-spark_2.12:4.1.5_for_spark_3` | `org.neo4j:neo4j-connector-apache-spark_2.13:4.1.5_for_spark_3` |

Make sure to include the appropriate dependency in your Spark configuration to ensure compatibility with Memgraph when 
performing high-speed graph ingestion. 🚀-

## Running Memgraph with Docker
To start Memgraph using Docker, use the following command:
```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 memgraph/memgraph
```
This command runs Memgraph in an interactive mode, exposing its Bolt and web ports.

## CSV File Structure
Before running the ingestion script, ensure your CSV files are structured correctly:
- **Node CSV (`pokec_medium_nodes.csv` -> 100k nodes)**
  - Contains a single column:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for each person

- **Relationship CSV (`pokec_medium_relationships.csv` -> 1.7 million edges)**
  - Contains two columns:
    - `from_id`: ID of the starting node (person)
    - `to_id`: ID of the connected node (person)

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Establish Connection to Memgraph
```python
from gqlalchemy import Memgraph
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import time

# Connection to Memgraph
url = "bolt://localhost:7687"
dbname = "memgraph"

memgraph = Memgraph()
```
Memgraph is initialized using the `gqlalchemy` Python client, establishing a connection via Bolt protocol.

### 2. Configure Memgraph for Optimal Ingestion
```python
memgraph.execute("STORAGE MODE IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL;")
memgraph.execute("DROP GRAPH;")
memgraph.execute("CREATE INDEX ON :Person")
memgraph.execute("CREATE INDEX ON :Person(id)")
```
#### Why `IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL` is Important for Multithreading
Setting **STORAGE MODE IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL** allows Memgraph to operate entirely in memory, maximizing data 
processing speed and enabling efficient multi-threaded execution. This mode significantly improves performance for analytical queries and bulk inserts.

#### How `DROP GRAPH` Instantly Clears the Dataset
Executing **DROP GRAPH** removes all existing data in Memgraph instantaneously. This ensures that each ingestion 
process starts with a clean slate, avoiding conflicts and ensuring consistent performance.

#### Why Indexing Improves Relationship Ingestion
Creating indexes on the `Person` label and its `id` property speeds up node lookups when relationships are created.
 Without indexing, the database would perform a full scan to find matching nodes, making relationship ingestion significantly slower.

### 3. Initialize Spark Session
```python
spark = (
    SparkSession.builder.config("neo4j.url", url)
    .config("neo4j.authentication.basic.username", "")
    .config("neo4j.authentication.basic.password", "")
    .config(
        "spark.jars.packages",
        "org.neo4j:neo4j-connector-apache-spark_2.12:5.1.0_for_spark_3",
    )
    .config("spark.driver.extraJavaOptions", "-Djava.security.manager=allow")
    .config("spark.executor.extraJavaOptions", "-Djava.security.manager=allow")
    .config("neo4j.database", dbname)
    .getOrCreate()
)
```
The Spark session is configured with the Memgraph connector to facilitate data ingestion.

### 4. Load Nodes from CSV and Write to Memgraph
```python
csv_file_path = "pokec_medium_nodes.csv"
df = spark.read.csv(csv_file_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)

node_ingest_start_time = time.time()
(
    df.write.format("org.neo4j.spark.DataSource")
    .mode("Overwrite")
    .option("labels", "Person")
    .option("node.keys", "id")
    .option("batch.size", 5000)
    .option("numPartitions", 10)
    .save()
)
node_ingest_end_time = time.time()

print(f"✅ Nodes successfully ingested into Memgraph from CSV after {(node_ingest_end_time - node_ingest_start_time):.2f}s!")
```

After running this part, we can observe the loading time:

**✅ Nodes successfully ingested into Memgraph from CSV after 1.85s!**              

#### Optimizing Node Ingestion
- **Batch size of 5000**: Processes data in chunks to improve efficiency.
- **10 partitions**: Utilizes multiple threads for parallel processing, reducing ingestion time.
- **Overwrite mode**: Ensures a fresh start for the dataset.

### 5. Load Relationships and Write to Memgraph
```python
relationships_csv_path = "pokec_medium_relationships.csv"
relationships_df = spark.read.csv(relationships_csv_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)

query = """
MATCH (p1:Person {id:event.from_id})
MATCH (p2:Person {id:event.to_id})
CREATE (p1)-[:CONNECTED_TO]->(p2)
"""

rel_ingest_start_time = time.time()
(
    relationships_df.write.format("org.neo4j.spark.DataSource")
    .mode("Append")
    .option("query", query)
    .option("batch.size", 1000)
    .option("numPartitions", 8)
    .save()
)
rel_ingest_end_time = time.time()

print(f"✅ Relationships successfully ingested into Memgraph after {(rel_ingest_end_time - rel_ingest_start_time):.2f}s!")
```
#### Optimizing Relationship Ingestion
- **Batch size of 1000**: Ensures efficient transaction handling.
- **8 partitions**: Balances parallelism with system resources.
- **Using indexed node lookups**: The `MATCH` query relies on indexes for fast lookups.

After ingesting the relationships, we can observe the loading part:

**✅ Relationships successfully ingested into Memgraph after 3.10s!**

## Conclusion
This script showcases how Memgraph, when combined with Spark, can rapidly ingest millions of edges in seconds by leveraging:
- **In-memory storage for parallel processing**
- **Efficient indexing for quick node lookups**
- **Multi-threaded Spark ingestion with batch processing**

For further optimization, consider tuning batch sizes and partition numbers based on hardware resources.
