Memgraph is fully compatible with Neo4jâ€™s **Cypher query language** and **Bolt
protocol**, making it easy to transition your graph data with minimal effort.  
Depending on your use case, dataset size, and workflow preferences, you can
choose one of the following three migration methods.


## Migrate using CSV files

This method involves **exporting your Neo4j data to CSV** and then **importing
it into Memgraph** using the `LOAD CSV` command.

### When to use
- You prefer a **manual, step-by-step** migration process.  
- You want **full control** over data transformation and indexing.  
- Ideal for **medium to large datasets** when export/import time is acceptable.

### Key features
- Uses Neo4jâ€™s APOC library to export data (`CALL apoc.export.csv.all`).  
- Data imported into Memgraph using `LOAD CSV` in **Memgraph Lab**.  
- Offers **fine-grained control** over node and relationship creation.

## Migrate using a single Cypher query

This approach uses the **`migrate.neo4j`** procedure from the **MAGE module** to
**stream data directly** from Neo4j into Memgraph â€” no intermediate files
required.

### When to use
- You want a **fast and automated** migration process.  
- You prefer to **avoid manual export/import** steps.  
- Best for **large or live datasets** with minimal downtime.

### Key features
- Runs a **single Cypher query** to copy nodes and relationships.  
- Supports **automatic property and label mapping**.  
- Can selectively migrate **entire graphs or subsets**.  
- Available out of the box in the `memgraph/memgraph-mage` Docker image.

## Migrate using the MAGE `migrate.neo4j()` module

For more **granular control** or **custom migration logic**, you can use the
`migrate.neo4j()` procedure directly from the **MAGE** module.

### When to use
- You want to **script or customize** your migration queries.  
- You need to migrate **specific labels, relationship types**, or run
  **analytical queries** during migration.  
- Youâ€™re integrating migration into a **larger ETL or automation pipeline**.

### Key features
- Streams Neo4j data into Memgraph via Cypher queries.  
- Supports three input modes:
  - `(:Label)` â†’ stream nodes  
  - `[:REL_TYPE]` â†’ stream relationships  
  - custom Cypher â†’ stream arbitrary query results  
- Full control over recreating nodes, relationships, and properties.

## Choosing the right method

| Use Case | Recommended Method |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Manual migration with export/import control | **CSV files** |
| Full graph migration with minimal effort | **Single Cypher query** |
| Selective or programmable migration | **MAGE `migrate.neo4j()`** |

---

<Callout type="tip" title="Tip">
All three methods can coexist!  
Start with the CSV approach for validation, and once confident, switch to the
single-query or MAGE-based migration for production-grade efficiency.
