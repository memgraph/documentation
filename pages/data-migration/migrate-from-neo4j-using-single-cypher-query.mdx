# Migrate from Neo4j to Memgraph with a single cypher query

Migrating your graph database from **Neo4j** to **Memgraph** can be done seamlessly using a single Cypher query,
thanks to Memgraphâ€™s built-in [**migrate** module](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/migrate). 
This approach eliminates the need for manual data exports and imports, making migration efficient and error-free.

The **migrate** module is available directly in the `memgraph/memgraph-mage` Docker image, allowing you
to execute migration queries out of the box without additional installations.

## Motivation for having the ready-made migration module
Many database migrations rely on exporting data to CSV files and then importing them into the target system.
While this method is widely used, it has several drawbacks:
- **Time-consuming**: Large datasets require significant time for export and re-import.
- **Manual intervention**: CSV formatting issues often require additional preprocessing.

### Benefits of direct migration from the source system
With Memgraphâ€™s `migrate` module, you can **stream data directly from Neo4j into Memgraph**, bypassing the need for intermediate files:
- **Instant data transfer**: No need to generate and handle large CSV files.
- **Automatic property mapping**: Ensures seamless migration of node and relationship properties.
- **Cypher expressiveness**: By streaming rows into Memgraph's query engine, you can migrate data and recreate nodes and relationships
in the same fashion
- **Efficient for large graphs**: Can handle millions of nodes and relationships efficiently.
- **No downtime**: Data can be transferred while Memgraph remains operational.

## Prerequisites
- **Neo4j** running on a specific Bolt port (e.g., `bolt://localhost:7687`)
- **Memgraph** running on a different Bolt port (e.g., `bolt://localhost:7688`)
- The **migrate** module available in the `memgraph/memgraph-mage` Docker image

## Start Neo4j and Memgraph
If you are running Neo4j and Memgraph on the same server, ensure they are running on different ports:

```sh
# Start Neo4j (default port 7687)
# Start Memgraph on a different port (7688) with MAGE pre-installed
docker run -it --rm -p 7688:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage
```

## Migrate the entire graph
To migrate the entire graph from Neo4j to Memgraph, use the following Cypher query in Memgraph:

```cypher
CALL migrate.neo4j(
    "MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) 
     RETURN properties(n) AS from_properties, 
            properties(r) AS edge_properties, 
            properties(m) AS to_properties", 
    {host: "localhost", port: 7687}) 
YIELD row 
RETURN row;
```

- The `MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)` query selects all nodes and relationships.
- The `RETURN` clause extracts node and relationship properties.
- The `{host: "localhost", port: 7687}` parameter specifies the Neo4j instance to migrate from.
- `YIELD row RETURN row` streams the data directly from Neo4j to Memgraph.

## Migrate specific data
If you want to migrate only certain parts of the graph, use the following queries:

### Migrate nodes with a specific label
```cypher
CALL migrate.neo4j(":Person", {host: "localhost", port: 7687}) YIELD row RETURN row;
```
This migrates all nodes with the `Person` label.

### Migrate relationships of a certain type
```cypher
CALL migrate.neo4j("[:KNOWS]", {host: "localhost", port: 7687}) YIELD row RETURN row;
```
This migrates only relationships of type `KNOWS`.

## Conclusion
Using Memgraphâ€™s `migrate` module, you can efficiently migrate your graph data from Neo4j with a single Cypher
query. Whether you are migrating the full dataset or specific labels/relationships, this method allows for 
**seamless, real-time streaming** without CSV exports. ðŸš€
