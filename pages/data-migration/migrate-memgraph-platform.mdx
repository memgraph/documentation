# Migrate from Memgraph Platform to Memgraph MAGE

Memgraph Platform was deployed as a single Docker image until version 2.15.
Starting with version 2.15, the platform has transitioned to a multi-container
application. This upgrade separates the previous single Docker image into
individual containers for Memgraph+MAGE and Memgraph Lab.

If you are running an older version of Memgraph Platform (versions up to 2.15),
you can migrate your data to the newer version of Memgraph MAGE.

## Using a database dump

Dumping the database in Memgraph creates a comprehensive record of the database state, encapsulating nodes, relationships, indexes, constraints, and triggers in Cypher queries. 
In this scenario, we are having two Memgraph instances:
1. Memgraph Platform
2. Memgraph MAGE


<Steps>
{<h3>Creating a database dump</h3>}

To create a dump of your Memgraph Platform database, execute the following command in `mgconsole`:

```cypher
DUMP DATABASE;
```

This command will generate a series of Cypher queries that represent the current state of the database. These queries can be used to recreate the database in its dumped state.
Copy this file to the location that will be accessible to the Memgraph MAGE instance.

    If you installed and started Memgraph MAGE using **Docker**, follow these steps:

    1. Open a new terminal and check the Docker container ID by running `docker ps`.
    2. Run the following command

      ```
      docker exec -i CONTAINER_ID mgconsole < queries.cypherl
      ```

    For more information about `mgconsole` options run:

    ```console
    docker exec -i CONTAINER_ID mgconsole --help
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    Once Memgraph MAGE is running in **Linux**, Cypher queries are imported by running
    [mgconsole](/getting-started/cli) in a non-interactive mode and importing data
    saved in a CYPHERL file.

    You can import queries saved in e.g. `queries.cypherl` by issuing the following
    shell command:

    ```plaintext
    mgconsole < queries.cypherl
    ```

    For more information about `mgconsole` options run:

    ```console
    mgconsole --help
  ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>



</Steps>

You can also use Memgraph Lab for exporting and importing .cypherl file

On the Memgraph Platform instance, run the Memgraph Lab and navigate to the `Export` section. You can export the database dump to a file with a `.cypherl` extension. 
Access the Memgraph MAGE instance using the Memgraph Lab desktop application and navigate to the `Import` section. Use the `.cypherl` dump to import the database state into the Memgraph MAGE instance.

For more details on using .cypherl, look at documentation on [working with .cypherl files](/data-migration/cypherl).
