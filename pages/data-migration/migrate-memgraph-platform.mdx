# Migrate from Memgraph Platform to Memgraph MAGE

Memgraph Platform was deployed as a single Docker image until version 2.15.
Starting with version 2.15, the platform has transitioned to a multi-container
application. This upgrade separates the previous single Docker image into
individual containers for Memgraph+MAGE and Memgraph Lab.

If you are running an older version of Memgraph Platform (versions up to 2.15),
you can migrate your data to the newer version of Memgraph using one of the
methods described below.

## Dumping the Database

Dumping the database in Memgraph creates a comprehensive record of the database state, encapsulating nodes, relationships, indexes, constraints, and triggers in Cypher queries. 

### Creating a Database Dump

To create a dump of your Memgraph database, execute the following command in `mgconsole` or Memgraph Lab:

```opencypher
DUMP DATABASE;
```

This command will generate a series of Cypher queries that represent the current state of the database. These queries can be used to recreate the database at its dumped state.

### Exporting the Dump File

In Memgraph Lab, navigate to the `Import & Export` section. Here, you can export the database dump to a file with a `.cypherl` extension. This file can be used to import the database state into another instance of Memgraph or for backup purposes.

## Importing a Database Dump

To import a database dump into Memgraph, you will need to execute the Cypher queries contained within the `.cypherl` file. This can be done through `mgconsole` or directly in Memgraph Lab.

1. Ensure your Memgraph instance is running and accessible.
2. Load the Cypher queries from your dump file into `mgconsole` or execute them in Memgraph Lab.

## Creating a snapshot

A snapshot in Memgraph is a backup of your database. Here's how you can create one:

1. Run the following query in `mgconsole` or Memgraph Lab:
```cypher
CREATE SNAPSHOT;
```
The snapshot is saved in the `snapshots` directory of the data directory (`/var/lib/memgraph`).

## Restoring a Snapshot

To restore a snapshot, you can follow these steps:

1. Copy the backed-up snapshot file into the `snapshots` directory after creating the container and start the database. The commands should look like this:
```bash
docker create -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v `snapshots`:/var/lib/memgraph/snapshots --name memgraphDB memgraph/memgraph
tar -cf - sample_snapshot_file | docker cp -a - memgraphDB:/var/lib/memgraph/snapshots
```
The `sample_snapshot_file` is the snapshot file you want to use to restore the data. 

2. After that, start the database with:
```bash
docker start -a memgraphDB
```
The `-a` flag is used to attach to the container's output so you can see the logs.

3. Once Memgraph is started, change the snapshot directory ownership to the `memgraph` user by running the following command:
```bash
docker exec -it -u 0 memgraphDB bash -c "chown memgraph:memgraph /var/lib/memgraph/snasphots"
```
Otherwise, Memgraph will not be able to write the future snapshot files and will fail.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Memgraph documentation](https://memgraph.com/docs/configuration/data-durability-and-backup).
