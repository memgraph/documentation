# System replication (Enterprise)

When distributing data across several instances, Memgraph uses replication.
This has now been expanded to include not only user data but system data as 
well. System data here means authentication/authorization data and 
multi-tenant setup data.

When using system replication features, the user can now have a more 
complete duplicate of MAIN. MAIN will automatically replicate any database
creation/drop and any changes to the auth setup.

## Audit logs

Audit logs are currently not replicated inside Memgraph.

## Auth data replication (Enterprise)

If you are using a Memgraph Enterprise license, all authentication/authorization
data, including users, roles, and associated permissions, will be replicated.

**Memgraph Community does not replicate users and roles.** It only ensures data replication
(nodes, relationships, indices, constraints, and other graph constructs).

## Auth modules replication

Authentication modules are not replicated and must be configured manually by the
administrator.

## Multi-tenant data replication (Enterprise)

When you are using a Memgraph Enterprise license, multi-tenant commands are
replicated as any other data command. 

Database manipulation is allowed only on MAIN. 
REPLICA instances have the ability to use databases and read data
contained in them.

When dropping a database used on a REPLICA, the REPLICA will receive the command
and will partially drop the database. It will hide the database and prevent any
new usage. Once all clients have released the database, it will be deleted
entirely.
