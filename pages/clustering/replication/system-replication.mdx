# System replication <sup style={{ fontSize: '0.6em', color: '#888' }}>Enterprise</sup>

In Memgraph Enterprise, replication extends beyond graph data.  
In addition to nodes, relationships, indexes, constraints, and triggers,
**system-level data** is also replicated across the cluster.

System replication ensures that REPLICA instances reflect not only the data
stored in the graph but also the **authentication setup**, **multi-tenant
configuration**,  
and **database lifecycle operations** performed on the MAIN instance.

This enables REPLICAs to behave as consistent, fully usable read copies of the
MAIN.

## Audit logs

Audit logs are currently **not** replicated inside Memgraph.

## Auth data replication <sup style={{ fontSize: '0.6em', color: '#888' }}>Enterprise</sup>

If you are using a Memgraph Enterprise license, all authentication/authorization
data, including users, roles, and associated permissions, will be replicated.

<Callout>

**Memgraph Community does not replicate users and roles.** Only graph data
(nodes, relationships, indices, constraints, and other graph constructs) are
replicated.

## Auth modules replication

Authentication modules are not replicated and must be configured manually by the
administrator.

## Multi-tenant data replication <sup style={{ fontSize: '0.6em', color: '#888' }}>Enterprise</sup>

With multi-tenancy enabled in Memgraph Enterprise:

- Creating or dropping databases on the MAIN is replicated to all REPLICA instances.
- REPLICAs can **use** databases (read-only), but only the MAIN may **modify** them.

When a database is dropped:

1. REPLICA instances mark the database as hidden.
2. New sessions cannot use it.
3. Once all active sessions release the database, it is fully deleted.

This ensures safe and predictable removal of tenant databases across the cluster.
