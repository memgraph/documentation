# Replication commands reference

This page provides a comprehensive reference for all commands available in Memgraph Community 
Edition replication.

<Callout type="info">

This reference is for **Memgraph Community** users. If you have a **Memgraph Enterprise** 
license, we recommend using the [high availability features](/clustering/high-availability) 
instead, which provide automatic failover, load balancing, and comprehensive cluster management
capabilities.

## Role management commands

### SET REPLICATION ROLE TO REPLICA

Demotes an instance to the REPLICA role and sets the replication port.

```cypher
SET REPLICATION ROLE TO REPLICA WITH PORT <port_number>;
```

**Parameters:**
- `port_number` (integer): Port number for replication communication (1000-10000)

**Behavior:**
- Demotes the current instance from MAIN to REPLICA
- Sets the replication port for communication with the MAIN instance
- REPLICA instances can only accept read queries
- Default port 10000 is recommended for easier registration (used implicitly in other commands)

**Example:**
```cypher
SET REPLICATION ROLE TO REPLICA WITH PORT 10000;
```

**When to use:**
Use this as a first command on the instances you have chosen to be replicas.

### SET REPLICATION ROLE TO MAIN

Promotes a REPLICA instance to become the MAIN instance.

```cypher
SET REPLICATION ROLE TO MAIN;
```

**Behavior:**
- Promotes the current REPLICA instance to MAIN
- If the instance is already MAIN, command will make an exception
- Only one MAIN instance should exist in a replication cluster (pay close attention when managing this)
- If the original MAIN is still alive, conflicts may occur
- Requires manual conflict resolution if multiple MAINs exist

**When to use:**
Memgraph when being run first time is always thinking it's main, so there's no real need to run this query at the start.
Only time you would need this query is to perform manual leader election.

### SHOW REPLICATION ROLE

Displays the current replication role of the instance.

```cypher
SHOW REPLICATION ROLE;
```

**Returns:**
- Current replication role: "main" or "replica"

**Example output:**
```nocopy
+------------------+
| replication role |
+------------------+
| "replica"        |
+------------------+
```

**When to use:**
Since there is no out of the box routing mechanism in Memgraph Community, you can use this command to determine which instance is the MAIN instance.
It should give you enough information to decide on which instance you can perform writes or reads.

## Replica registration commands

### REGISTER REPLICA (SYNC)

Registers a REPLICA instance with synchronous replication mode.

```cypher
REGISTER REPLICA name SYNC TO <socket_address>;
```

**Parameters:**
- `name` (string): Unique name for the replica
- `socket_address` (string): Network address in format `"IP_ADDRESS|DNS_NAME:PORT_NUMBER"` or `"IP_ADDRESS|DNS_NAME"` (default port `10000`)

**Behavior:**
- MAIN will register a REPLICA instance under SYNC replication mode and sync its own data with the REPLICA

**Implications:**
- MAIN waits for confirmation from SYNC replicas before committing transactions
- if SYNC replica is down, MAIN can still commit and move on (unlike STRICT_SYNC),
  while the REPLICAs are expected to recover and catch-up eventually
- ensures data consistency, but with slower write performance
- there is a minimal chance for data loss, in which case manual intervention is needed to recover the data

**Example:**
```cypher
REGISTER REPLICA REP1 SYNC TO "172.17.0.3:10000";
```

### REGISTER REPLICA (ASYNC)

Registers a REPLICA instance with asynchronous replication mode.

```cypher
REGISTER REPLICA name ASYNC TO <socket_address>;
```

**Parameters:**
- `name` (string): Unique name for the replica
- `socket_address` (string): Network address in format "IP_ADDRESS|DNS_NAME:PORT_NUMBER" or "IP_ADDRESS|DNS_NAME" (default port 10000)

**Behavior:**
- MAIN will register a REPLICA instance under ASYNC replication mode and sync its own data with the REPLICA

**Implications:**
- MAIN commits transactions without waiting for replica confirmation, as data is replicated using a background thread
- ensures high availability and partition tolerance
- data is eventually consistent
- best performance but potential data loss on failover

**Example:**
```cypher
REGISTER REPLICA REP2 ASYNC TO "172.17.0.4";
```

### REGISTER REPLICA (STRICT_SYNC)

Registers a REPLICA instance with strict synchronous replication mode.

```cypher
REGISTER REPLICA name STRICT_SYNC TO <socket_address>;
```

**Parameters:**
- `name` (string): Unique name for the replica
- `socket_address` (string): Network address in format "IP_ADDRESS|DNS_NAME:PORT_NUMBER" or "IP_ADDRESS|DNS_NAME" (default port 10000)

**Behavior:**
- MAIN will register a REPLICA instance under STRICT_SYNC replication mode and sync its own data with the REPLICA

**Implications:**
- uses two-phase commit protocol (2PC)
- MAIN cannot commit if STRICT_SYNC replica is down
- ensures no data loss but reduces throughput because of 2PC
- best for high-availability scenarios requiring zero data loss

**Example:**
```cypher
REGISTER REPLICA REP3 STRICT_SYNC TO "172.17.0.5:10000";
```

### DROP REPLICA

Removes a REPLICA instance from the replication cluster.

```cypher
DROP REPLICA <name>;
```

**Parameters:**
- `name` (string): Name of the replica to remove

**Behavior:**
- unregisters the replica from the MAIN instance
- stops replication to the specified replica
- replica instance continues running as REPLICA but is no longer part of the cluster

**Example:**
```cypher
DROP REPLICA REP1;
```

**When to use:**
If all else fails, and the REPLICA can not recover, you can always drop and re-register the REPLICA to start fresh. We advise `DROP REPLICA`
followed by `REGISTER REPLICA` after which the recovery process should start, and the REPLICA should again catch up with the MAIN.

## Monitoring commands

### SHOW REPLICAS

Lists all registered REPLICA instances and their details.

```cypher
SHOW REPLICAS;
```

**Returns:**
- replica name
- network address of the REPLICA + port of the replication server
- replication mode (SYNC/ASYNC/STRICT_SYNC)
- system information
- tenant information (lag, status, timestamp)

**Example output:**
```nocopy
+--------+--------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| name   | socket_address     | sync_mode | system_info | data_info                                       |
+--------+--------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| "REP1" | "172.17.0.3:10000" | "sync"    | Null        | {memgraph: {behind: 0, status: "ready", ts: 0}} |
| "REP2" | "172.17.0.4:10000" | "async"   | Null        | {memgraph: {behind: 0, status: "ready", ts: 0}} |
+--------+--------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------+
```

## Socket address formats

### IP address format

```cypher
"IP_ADDRESS|DNS_NAME:PORT_NUMBER"
```

**Example:**
```cypher
"172.17.0.4:10050"
```

### IP address with default port

```cypher
"IP_ADDRESS"
```

**Example:**
```cypher
"172.17.0.5"
```

### DNS name format

```cypher
"DNS_NAME:PORT_NUMBER"
```

**Example:**
```cypher
"memgraph-replica.memgraph.net:10050"
```

### DNS name with default port

```cypher
"DNS_NAME"
```

**Example:**
```cypher
"memgraph-replica.memgraph.net"
```
