# System replication

<Callout>

Enterprise: System replication requires a Memgraph Enterprise license to
function. For more information on Memgraph Enterprise and instructions
on how to enable it, refer to the
[enabling Memgraph Enterprise documentation](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

The [system replication
feature](/database-management/experimental-features) was introduced in Memgraph
2.15. To use it, start Memgraph with the
`--experimental-enabled=system-replication` flag. By default, the
`--experimental-enabled` flag is an empty list.

</Callout>

When distributing data across several instances, Memgraph uses replication.
This has now been expanded to include not only user data but system data as 
well. System data here means authentication/authorization data and 
multi-tenant setup data.

When using system replication features, the user can now have a more 
complete duplicate of MAIN. MAIN will automatically replicate any database
creation/drop and any changes to the auth setup.

## Replication implementation basics

Please refer to [Replication](/clustering/replication) for the basics of replication.

## Auth data replication 

All authentication/authorization data are now replicated. This includes users,
roles, and all of the permissions associated with them. 

Auth modules are not replicated at this time and must be set up by the admin.

## Multi-tenant data replication 

Multi-tenant commands are now replicated as any other data command.
Database manipulation is allowed only on MAIN. However, REPLICAs have the
ability to use databases and read data contained in them.

When dropping a database used on a REPLICA, the REPLICA will receive the command
and will partially drop the database. It will hide it and not allow any new
usage of the database but will wait for every client to release the database
before deleting it entirely.
