# Best practices when setting up replication

<Callout type="info">

This guide is for **Memgraph Community** users who want to set up data replication across multiple instances.
If you have a **Memgraph Enterprise** license, we recommend using the [high availability features](/clustering/high-availability) instead, which provide automatic failover, 
load balancing, and comprehensive cluster management capabilities.

## Which storage mode to use?

Data replication currently **works only in the in-memory transactional [storage
mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage)**.

If you're using in-memory analytical storage mode for the fast import:
1. import your data
2. switch to in-memory transactional storage mode
3. then and only then set up replication

## Hardware requirements
For replication, ensure all machines (MAIN and REPLICA instances) have exactly the same amount of
RAM and the same CPU. This uniformity is crucial for consistent performance and reliability.

## Deployment requirements
When running multiple instances, each on its own machine, run Memgraph as you
usually would.

If you are exploring replication and running multiple instances on one machine,
you can run Memgraph with Docker, but if you are using volumes, they need to be
called differently and each instance needs to be exposed via a different port.

Check the example of creating [a replication
cluster](/clustering/replication/setup-replication-cluster-docker).



## Which command line flags should I use?

#### Data recovery on startup

**By default, Memgraph sets the data recovery on startup to true:**

```bash
--data_recovery_on_startup=true
```
The flag controls whether Memgraph will recover the persisted data during startup. It's necessary
to keep this value to true so instances which have temporarily shut down can recover their data when
they get back up.

**Advice:** Do nothing since this is enforced by default.

#### Restoring replication state on startup
Instances need to remember their role and configuration details in a replication
cluster upon restart, and that is **by default enforced** with the flag:

```bash
--replication-restore-state-on-startup=true
```
The flag should remain `true` throughout the instances' lifetime for replication to work correctly.
If the flag is set to `false`, MAIN can't communicate with instance, because each
REPLICA has a UUID of MAIN which can communicate with it, and it is set up only
on instance registration. In case the flag is set to `false`, the way to go
forward is first to unregister the instance on MAIN and register it again.

**Advice:** Do nothing since this is enforced by default.

#### Storage WAL file flush
Users are advised to use the same value for configuration flag
```bash
--storage-wal-file-flush-every-n-txn
```
on MAIN and SYNC REPLICAs. Otherwise, the situation could occur in which there is a data which is
*fsynced* on REPLICA and not on MAIN. In the case MAIN crashes, this could leave to conflicts in system
that would need to be manually resolved by users.

**Advice:** Do nothing since this the value is identical for all instances by default. If you change the value
for the flag, change it for all the respective instances accordingly.

## Permissions to run replication queries

As of Memgraph v3.5 replication queries (such as `REGISTER REPLICA`, `SHOW
REPLICAS`, `DROP REPLICA`, etc.) target the default "memgraph" database and
require access to it. The recommendation is to use the default "memgraph"
database as an admin/system database and store graphs under other databases. 

**In Memgraph community, every user is an admin user and there are no roles or privileges, so
users will be able to execute any replication query.**

### Requirements for replication queries (Enterprise)

To execute replication queries, users must have:
1. The `REPLICATION` privilege
2. **AND** access to the default "memgraph" database

**In Memgraph Enterprise edition, the very first created user is an admin user, which will be able to execute
any replication query.**

{<h4 className="custom-header">Example: Admin user with replication privileges</h4>}

```cypher
-- Create admin role with replication privileges
CREATE ROLE replication_admin;
GRANT REPLICATION TO replication_admin;
GRANT DATABASE memgraph TO replication_admin;

-- Create user with replication admin role
CREATE USER repl_admin IDENTIFIED BY 'admin_password';
SET ROLE FOR repl_admin TO replication_admin;
```

In this setup, `repl_admin` can:
- Execute all replication queries (`REGISTER REPLICA`, `SHOW REPLICAS`, etc.)
- Access the "memgraph" database for administrative operations
- Manage the replication cluster configuration

## How to manage replication with Memgraph Community Edition?

### Manual failover

**Leader election / automatic failover** is a part of Memgraph Enterprise Edition. For Memgraph 
Community edition, users need to perform manual failover routines.

The replication cluster should only have one MAIN instance in order to avoid
errors in the replication system. If the original MAIN instance fails, you can
promote a REPLICA instance to be the new MAIN instance by running the following
query:

```plaintext
SET REPLICATION ROLE TO MAIN;
```

If the original instance was still alive when you promoted a new MAIN, you need
to resolve any conflicts and manage replication manually.

If you demote the new MAIN instance back to the REPLICA role, it will not
retrieve its original function. You need to [drop
it](/clustering/replication/replication-commands-reference#drop-replica) from the MAIN and 
[register it](/clustering/replication/replication-commands-reference#replica-registration-commands) again.

If the crashed MAIN instance goes back online once a new MAIN is already
assigned, it cannot reclaim its previous role. It needs to be cleaned and demoted to
become a REPLICA instance of the new MAIN instance. In the worst case, restarting that instance
clean with new fresh storage is needed, in order for the REPLICA registration to pass successfully.
