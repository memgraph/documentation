# Setup replication cluster with Kubernetes

<Callout type="info">

This guide is for **Memgraph Community** users who want to set up data
replication across multiple instances. If you have a **Memgraph Enterprise**
license, we recommend using the [high availability
features](/clustering/high-availability) instead, which provide automatic
failover, load balancing, and comprehensive cluster management capabilities.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

Memgraph Community currently has **no built-in Helm chart** for replication.  
Only the High Availability (Enterprise) edition provides official Helm support:
[Memgraph HA Helm
Chart](https://github.com/memgraph/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/memgraph-high-availability).

To deploy a replication cluster with Community edition on Kubernetes, you will
need to create the manifests yourself.  
A common approach is to:

1. Follow the [Docker replication
   guide](/clustering/replication/setup-replication-cluster-docker) to
   understand the required roles, ports, and setup steps.
2. Use the [Memgraph standalone Helm
   chart](https://github.com/memgraph/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/memgraph) or
   your own Kubernetes manifests to deploy:
   - One MAIN instance  
   - One or more REPLICA instances  
3. Configure replication by running the appropriate Cypher commands (`SET
   REPLICATION ROLE`, `REGISTER REPLICA`, etc.) through a client.

At the moment, this section serves as a reference for users deploying Memgraph
Community clusters on Kubernetes manually.
