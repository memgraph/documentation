# Setup replication cluster with Kubernetes (Community)

<Callout type="info">

This guide is for **Memgraph Community** users who want to set up data replication across multiple instances.
If you have a **Memgraph Enterprise** license, we recommend using the [high availability features](/clustering/high-availability) instead, which provide automatic failover, 
load balancing, and comprehensive cluster management capabilities.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

Memgraph does not offer Helm charts compatible with Memgraph replication in Community Edition.
Memgraph currently only supports Helm charts with the [high availability 
Enterprise edition](https://github.com/memgraph/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/memgraph-high-availability). 
If you want to set up replication with Community Memgraph using Helm charts, you are encouraged to create 
the setup on your own, by [reusing the Docker replication guide](/clustering/replication/setup-replication-cluster-docker)
and [Memgraph standalone Helm Charts](https://github.com/memgraph/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/memgraph)
for setting up the cluster.
