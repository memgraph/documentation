# Frequently asked questions

## High availability (general)

#### Does Memgraph support chaining REPLICA instances?
Memgraph at the moment doesn't support chaining REPLICA instances, that is, a REPLICA
instance cannot be replicated on another REPLICA instance.

#### Can a REPLICA listen to multiple MAIN instances?
When starting any Memgraph instance, it is assigned a unique UUID of the instance. This is communicated
when a replica is registered, to ensure REPLICA does not receive replication data from another MAIN instance.
A REPLICA stores the UUID of the MAIN instance it listens to.
The instance UUID of each Memgraph is persisted on disk across restarts, so this behaviour is enforced throughout the
cluster lifecycle.
