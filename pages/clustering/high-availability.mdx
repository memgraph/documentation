Before setting up a High Availability (HA) cluster, we strongly recommend
reading the following guides:

- [How replication works](/clustering/replication/how-replication-works)
- [How high availability
  works](/clustering/high-availability/how-high-availability-works)
- [How to query an HA
  cluster](/clustering/high-availability/querying-the-cluster-in-high-availability)

These will give you the foundational concepts needed to understand and operate
the cluster effectively.
