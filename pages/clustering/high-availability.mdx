# High availability (Enterprise)

A cluster is considered highly available if, at any point, there is some instance that can respond to a user query. Our high availability 
relies on replication. The cluster consists of:
- The MAIN instance on which the user can execute write queries
- REPLICA instances that can only respond to read queries
- COORDINATOR instances that manage the cluster state.

Depending on how configuration flags are set, Memgraph can run as a data instance or coordinator instance. 
The coordinator instance is a new addition to enable the high availability feature and orchestrates data instances to ensure that there is always one MAIN instance in the cluster.

## Cluster management

For achieving high availability, Memgraph uses Raft consensus protocol, which is very similar to Paxos in terms of performance and fault-tolerance but with 
a significant advantage that it is much easier to understand. It's important to say that Raft isn't a
Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm. You can learn more about Raft in the paper [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf).

Typical Memgraph's highly available cluster consists of 3 data instances (1 MAIN and 2 REPLICAS) and 3 coordinator instances backed up by Raft protocol.
Users can create more than 3 coordinators, but the replication factor (RF) of 3 is a de facto standard in distributed databases.

One coordinator instance is the leader whose job is to always ensure one writeable data instance (MAIN). The other two coordinator instances replicate
changes the leader coordinator did in its own Raft log. Operations saved into the Raft log are those that are related to cluster management. Memgraph doesn't have its 
implementation of the Raft protocol. For this task, Memgraph uses an industry-proven library [NuRaft](https://github.com/eBay/NuRaft).

You can start the coordinator instance by specifying `--coordinator-id`, 
`--coordinator-port` and `--management-port` flags. Followers ping the leader on the `--management-port` to get health state of the cluster. The coordinator instance only responds to
queries related to high availability, so you cannot execute any data-oriented query on it. The coordinator port is used for the Raft protocol, which
all coordinators use to ensure the consistency of the cluster's state. Data instances are distinguished from coordinator instances by
specifying only `--management-port` flag. This port is used for RPC network communication between the coordinator and data
instances. When started by default, the data instance is MAIN. The coordinator will ensure that no data inconsistency can happen during and after the instance's
restart. Once all instances are started, the user can start adding data instances to the cluster.

<Callout type="info">

The Raft consensus algorithm ensures that all nodes in a distributed system
agree on a single source of truth, even in the presence of failures, by electing
a leader to manage a replicated log. It simplifies the management of the
replicated log across the cluster, providing a way to achieve consistency and
coordination in a fault-tolerant manner. Users are advised to use an odd number of instances
since Raft, as a consensus algorithm, works by forming a majority in the decision making.

## Bolt+routing

Directly connecting to the MAIN instance isn't preferred in the HA cluster since the MAIN instance changes due to various failures. Because of that, users
can use bolt+routing so that write queries can always be sent to the correct data instance. This protocol works so that the client
first sends a ROUTE bolt message to any coordinator instance. The coordinator replies to the message by returning the routing table with three entries specifying
from which instance can be data read, to which instance data can be written and which instances can behave as routers. In the Memgraph HA cluster, the MAIN
data instance is the only writeable instance, REPLICAs are readable instances, and COORDINATORs behave as routers. 
For more details check [Request message ROUTE](https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/bolt/message/#messages-route) documentation.

Users only need to change the scheme they use for connecting to coordinators. This means instead of using `bolt://<main_ip_address>,` you should
use `neo4j://<coordinator_ip_adresss>` to get an active connection to the current MAIN instance in the cluster. You can find examples of how to 
use bolt+routing in different programming languages [here](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/tree/master/tests/drivers).

It is important to note that setting up the cluster on one coordinator (registration of data instances and coordinators, setting main) must be done using bolt connection 
since bolt+routing is only used for routing data-related queries, not coordinator-based queries.

## System configuration

<Callout type="warning">
Important note if you're using native Memgraph deployment with Red Hat.

Red Hat uses SELinux to enforce security policies.
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security mechanism for implementing mandatory access control (MAC) in the Linux kernel.
It restricts programs, users, and processes to only the resources they require, following a least-privilege model.
When deploying Memgraph with high availability (HA), consider checking out this attribute for instance visibility and 
setting the level of security mechanism to permissive.

This rule could also apply to CentOS and Fedora, but at the moment it's not tested and verified.
 </Callout>

## Starting instances

You can start the data and coordinator instances using environment flags or configuration flags.
The main difference between data instance and coordinator is that data instances have `--management-port`, whereas coordinators must have `--coordinator-id` and `--coordinator-port`. 

### Configuration Flags

#### Data instance

Memgraph data instance must use flag `--management-port=<port>`. This flag is tied to the high availability feature, enables the coordinator to connect to the data instance, 
and allows the Memgraph data instance to use the high availability feature.

```
docker run --name instance1 -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage
--management-port=13011 \
--bolt-port=7692 \
```

#### Coordinator instance 

```
docker run --name coord1 -p 7691:7691 -p 7445:7444 memgraph/memgraph-mage
--coordinator-port=10111 
--bolt-port=7691
--coordinator-id=1 
--coordinator-hostname=localhost
--management-port=12121
```

Coordinator IDs serve as identifiers, the coordinator port is used for synchronization and log replication between coordinators and management port is used to get health state of 
cluster from leader coordinator. Coordinator IDs, coordinator ports and management ports must be different for all coordinators.

Configuration option `--coordinator-hostname` must be set on all coordinator instances. It is used on followers to ping the leader coordinator on the correct IP address and return 
the health state about the cluster. You can set this configuration flag to the IP address, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or even the DNS name. 
The suggested approach is to use DNS, otherwise, in case the IP address changes, network communication between instances in the cluster will stop working.

When testing on a local setup, the flag `--coordinator-hostname` should be set to `localhost` for each instance.

It is important that in the host you set the bolt ports distinct for every instance, regardless of them being a data instance, or a coordinator instance.

### Env flags

There is an additional way to set high availability instances using environment variables. It is important to say that for the following configuration options, you can either use
environment variables or configuration flags:

- bolt port
- coordinator port
- coordinator id
- management port
- high availability durability
- path to nuraft log file
- coordinator hostname

#### Data instances

Here are the environment variables you need to use to set data instance using only environment variables:

```
export MEMGRAPH_MANAGEMENT_PORT=13011
export MEMGRAPH_BOLT_PORT=7692
```

When using any of these environment variables, flags `--bolt-port` and `--management-port` will be ignored.


#### Coordinator instances

```
export MEMGRAPH_COORDINATOR_PORT=10111
export MEMGRAPH_COORDINATOR_ID=1
export MEMGRAPH_BOLT_PORT=7687
export MEMGRAPH_HA_DURABILITY=true
export MEMGRAPH_NURAFT_LOG_FILE="<path-to-log-file>"
export MEMGRAPH_COORDINATOR_HOSTNAME="localhost"
export MEMGRAPH_MANAGEMENT_PORT=12121
```

When using any of these environment variables, flags for `--bolt-port`, `--coordinator-port`, `--coordinator-id` and `--coordinator-hostname` will be ignored.


There is an additional environment variable you can use to set the path to the file with cypher queries used to start a high availability cluster.
Here, you can use queries we define in the next chapter called User API.

```
export MEMGRAPH_HA_CLUSTER_INIT_QUERIES=<file_path>
```
After the coordinator instance is started, Memgraph will run queries one by one from this file to set up a high availability cluster.

## User API

### Register instance

Registering instances should be done on a single coordinator. The chosen coordinator will become the cluster's leader.

Register instance query will result in several actions:
1. The coordinator instance will connect to the data instance on the `management_server` network address.
2. The coordinator instance will start pinging the data instance every `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec` seconds to check its status.
3. Data instance will be demoted from MAIN to REPLICA.
4. Data instance will start the replication server on `replication_server`.

```plaintext
REGISTER INSTANCE instanceName WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": boltServer, "management_server": managementServer, "replication_server": replicationServer};
```

This operation will result in writing to the Raft log.

In case the MAIN instance already exists in the cluster, a replica instance will also be registered on MAIN.


### Add coordinator instance

The user can choose any coordinator instance and connect other two (or more) coordinator instances to the cluster. This can be done before or after registering data instances,
the order isn't important. 

```plaintext
ADD COORDINATOR coordinatorId WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": boltServer, "coordinator_server": coordinatorServer}; 
```

<Callout type="info">

We need to inform the leader coordinator of the existence of other follower coordinators.
If you are running `ADD COORDINATOR` cypher queries on coordinator with --coordinator-id=1, you only need to add other two coordinator instances. For example, when using 3 
coordinators you need to use two `ADD COORDINATOR` queries:

```
ADD COORDINATOR 2 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "127.0.0.1:7692", "coordinator_server": "127.0.0.1:10112", "management_server": "127.0.0.1:12112"};
ADD COORDINATOR 3 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "127.0.0.1:7693", "coordinator_server": "127.0.0.1:10113", "management_server": "127.0.0.1:12113"};
```

</Callout>

### Remove coordinator instance

If during cluster setup or at some later stage of cluster life, the user decides to remove some coordinator instance, `REMOVE COORDINATOR` query can be used.
Only on leader can this query be executed in order to remove followers. Current cluster's leader cannot be removed since this is prohibited
by NuRaft. In order to remove the current leader, you first need to trigger leadership change.

```plaintext
REMOVE COORDINATOR <COORDINATOR-ID>;
```


### Set instance to MAIN

Once all data instances are registered, one data instance should be promoted to MAIN. This can be achieved by using the following query:

```plaintext
SET INSTANCE instanceName to MAIN;
```

This query will register all other instances as REPLICAs to the new MAIN. If one of the instances is unavailable, setting the instance to MAIN will not succeed.
If there is already a MAIN instance in the cluster, this query will fail. 

This operation will result in writing to the Raft log.

### Unregister instance

There are various reasons which could lead to the decision that an instance needs to be removed from the cluster. The hardware can be broken,
network communication could be set up incorrectly, etc. The user can remove the instance from the cluster using the following query:

```plaintext
UNREGISTER INSTANCE instanceName;
```

At the moment of registration, the instance that you want to unregister must not be MAIN because unregistering MAIN could lead to an inconsistent cluster state. 

The instance requested to be unregistered will also be unregistered from the current MAIN's REPLICA set.

### Demote instance

Demoting instances should be done by a leader coordinator.

Demote instance query will result in several actions:
1. The coordinator instance will demote the instance to REPLICA.
2. The coordinator instance will continue pinging the data instance every `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec` seconds to check its status.
In this case, the leader coordinator won't choose a new MAIN, but as a user, you should choose one instance to promote it to MAIN using the `SET INSTANCE `instance` TO MAIN` query.

```plaintext
DEMOTE INSTANCE instanceName;
```

This operation will result in writing to the Raft log.


### Force reset cluster state

In case the cluster gets stuck there is an option to do the force reset of the cluster. You need to execute a command on the leader coordinator. 
This command will result in the following actions:

1. The coordinator instance will demote each alive instance to REPLICA.
2. From the alive instance it will choose a new MAIN instance.
3. Instances that are down will be demoted to REPLICAs once they come back up.

```plaintext
FORCE RESET CLUSTER STATE;
```

This operation will result in writing to the Raft log.

### Show instances

You can check the state of the whole cluster using the `SHOW INSTANCES` query. The query will display all the Memgraph servers visible in the cluster. With
each server you can see the following information:
 1. Network ports they are using for managing cluster state
 2. Health state of server
 3. Role - MAIN, REPLICA, LEADER, FOLLOWER or unknown if not alive
 4. The time passed since the last response time to the leader's health ping 

This query can be run on either the leader or followers. Since only the leader knows the exact status of the health state and last response time, 
followers will execute actions in this exact order:
  1. Try contacting the leader to get the health state of the cluster, since the leader has all the information. 
  If the leader responds, the follower will return the result as if the `SHOW INSTANCES` query was run on the leader.
  2. When the leader doesn't respond or currently there is no leader, the follower will return all the Memgraph servers
   with the health state set to "down".

```plaintext
SHOW INSTANCES;
```

### Show instance

You can check the state of the current coordinator to which you are connected by running the following query:

```plaintext
SHOW INSTANCE;
```

This query will return the information about:
1. instance name 
2. external bolt server to which you can connect using Memgraph clients 
3. coordinator server over which Raft communication is done 
4. management server which is also used for inter-coordinators communication and 
5. cluster role: whether the coordinator is currently a leader of the follower.


## Setting config for highly-available cluster

There are several flags that you can use for managing the cluster. Flag `--management-port` is used by both data instances
and coordinators. The provided flag needs to be unique. Setting a flag will create an RPC server on instances capable of 
responding to the coordinator's RPC messages. 

<Callout type="info">

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a protocol for executing functions on a remote
system. RPC enables direct communication in distributed systems and is crucial
for replication and high availability tasks.

</Callout>

Flags `--coordinator-id`, `--coordinator-port` and `--management-port` need to be unique and specified on coordinator instances. They will cause the creation of a Raft 
server that coordinator instances use for communication. Flag `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec` specifies how often should leader coordinator
check the status of the replication instance to update its status. Flag `--instance-down-timeout-sec` gives the user the ability to control how much time should
pass before the coordinator starts considering the instance to be down. 

<Callout type="info">

Consider the instance to be down only if several consecutive pings fail because a single ping can fail because of a large number of different reasons in distributed systems.

</Callout>

There is an additional flag, `--instance-get-uuid-frequency-sec`, which sets 
how often the coordinator should check on REPLICA instances if they follow the correct MAIN instance. REPLICA may die and get back up
before the coordinator notices that. In that case, REPLICA will not follow MAIN for `--instance-get-uuid-frequency-sec` seconds. It is advisable to set 
the flag to more than `--instance-down-timeout-sec`, as it is needed first to confirm the instance was down and not that there was some networking issue.


## Failover

### Determining instance's health

Every `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec` seconds, the coordinator contacts each instance. 
The instance is not considered to be down unless `--instance-down-timeout-sec` has passed and the instance hasn't responded to the coordinator in the meantime. 
Users must set `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec` to be less or equal to the `--instance-down-timeout-sec` but we advise users to set `--instance-down-timeout-sec` to 
a multiplier of `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec`. Set the multiplier coefficient to be N>=2. 
For example, set `--instance-down-timeout-sec=5` and `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec=1` which will result in coordinator contacting each instance every second and 
the instance is considered dead after it doesn't respond 5 times (5 seconds / 1 second).

In case a REPLICA doesn't respond to a health check, the leader coordinator will try to contact it again every `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec`. 
When the REPLICA instance rejoins the cluster (comes back up), it always rejoins as REPLICA. For MAIN instance, there are two options. 
If it is down for less than `--instance-down-timeout-sec`, it will rejoin as MAIN because it is still considered alive. If it is down for more than `--instance-down-timeout-sec`, 
the failover procedure is initiated. Whether MAIN will rejoin as MAIN depends on the success of the failover procedure. If the failover procedure succeeds, now old MAIN
will rejoin as REPLICA. If failover doesn't succeed, MAIN will rejoin as MAIN once it comes back up.

### Failover procedure - high level description

From alive REPLICAs coordinator chooses a new potential MAIN.
This instance is only potentially new MAIN as the failover procedure can still fail due to various factors (networking issues, promote to MAIN fails, any alive REPLICA failing to 
accept an RPC message, etc). The coordinator sends an RPC request to the potential new MAIN, which is still in REPLICA state, to promote itself to the MAIN instance with info
about other REPLICAs to which it will replicate data. Once that request succeeds, the new MAIN can start replication to the other instances and accept write queries.


### Choosing new MAIN from available REPLICAs

When failover is happening, some REPLICAs can also be down. From the list of alive REPLICAs, a new MAIN is chosen. First, the leader coordinator contacts each alive REPLICA
to get info about each database's last commit timestamp. In the case of enabled multi-tenancy, from each instance coordinator will get info on all databases and their last commit
timestamp. Currently, the coordinator chooses an instance to become a new MAIN by comparing the latest commit timestamp only of the default database for every instance. 
If multiple instances have the same latest commit timestamp, the instance that was registered earlier will be chosen as a new MAIN. 


### Old MAIN rejoining to the cluster

Once the old MAIN gets back up, the coordinator sends an RPC request to demote the old MAIN to REPLICA. The coordinator tracks at all times which instance was the last MAIN. 

The leader coordinator sends two RPC requests in the given order to demote old MAIN to REPLICA:
1. Demote MAIN to REPLICA RPC request
2. A request to store the UUID of the current MAIN, which the old MAIN, now acting as a REPLICA instance, must listen to.

### How REPLICA knows which MAIN to listen

Each REPLICA has a UUID of MAIN it listens to. If a network partition happens where MAIN can talk to a REPLICA but the coordinator can't talk to the MAIN, from the coordinator's
point of view that MAIN is down. From REPLICA's point of view, the MAIN instance is still alive. The coordinator will start the failover procedure, and we can end up with multiple MAINs
where REPLICAs can listen to both MAINs. To prevent such an issue, each REPLICA gets a new UUID that no current MAIN has. The coordinator generates the new UUID, 
which the new MAIN will get to use on its promotion to MAIN. 

If REPLICA was down at one point, MAIN could have changed. When REPLICA gets back up, it doesn't listen to any MAIN until the coordinator sends an RPC request to REPLICA to start
listening to MAIN with the given UUID.

### Replication concerns

#### Force sync of data 

On failover, the current logic is to choose the most-up-to-date instance from all available instances to promote to the new MAIN. For promotion to the MAIN
to successfully happen, the new MAIN figures out if REPLICA is behind (has less up-to-date data) or has data that the new MAIN doesn't have.
If REPLICA has data that MAIN doesn't have, in that case REPLICA is in a diverged-from-MAIN state. If at least one REPLICA is in diverged-from-MAIN
state, failover won't succeed as MAIN can't replicate data to diverged-from-MAIN REPLICA.
When choosing a new MAIN in the failover procedure from the list of available REPLICAs, the instance with the latest commit timestamp for the default database is chosen as the new MAIN. 
In case some other instance had more up-to-date data when the failover procedure was choosing a new MAIN but was down at that point when rejoining the cluster, 
the new MAIN instance sends a force sync RPC request to such instance. Force sync RPC request deletes all current data on all databases on a given instance and accepts data from the 
current MAIN. This way cluster will always follow the current MAIN. 


## Actions on follower coordinators

From follower coordinators you can only execute `SHOW INSTANCES`. Registration of data instance, unregistration of data instances, demoting instance, setting instance to MAIN and 
force reseting cluster state are all disabled. 

<Callout type="warning">

Under certain extreme scenarios, the current implementation of HA could lead to having Recovery Point Objective (RPO) != 0 (aka data loss). These are environments with high volume of transactions 
where data is constantly changed, added, deleted... If you are operating in such scenarios, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/memgraph/memgraph/issues) 
as we are eager to expand our support for this kind of workload.

</Callout>

## Instances' restart

### Data instances' restart
Data instances can fail both as MAIN and as REPLICA. When an instance that was REPLICA comes back, it won't accept updates from any instance until the coordinator updates its
responsible peer. This should happen automatically when the coordinator's ping to the instance passes. When the MAIN instance comes back, any writing to the MAIN instance will be 
forbidden until a ping from the coordinator passes. 

### Coordinator instances restart

In case the coordinator instance dies and it is restarted, it will not lose any data from the RAFT log or RAFT snapshots, since `--ha-durability` is enabled by default. 
For more details read about high availability durability in the durability chapter.


## Durability

High availability durability is enabled by default. Durability flag controls logs and snapshots. Details about other coordinators are always made durable
since without that information, the coordinator can't rejoin the cluster.

Information about logs and snapshots is stored under one RocksDB instance in the `high_availability/raft_data/logs` directory stored under 
the top-level `--data-directory` folder. All the data stored there is recovered in case the coordinator restarts.

Data about other coordinators and their endpoints is recovered from the `high_availability/raft_data/network` directory stored under 
the top-level `--data-directory` folder. When the coordinator rejoins, it will communicate with other coordinators and receive updates from the current leader.

In case durability is disabled, at least one coordinator must be alive at all times so that data from the Raft log is not lost.

### First start 

On the first start of coordinators, each will store the current version of the `logs` and `network` durability store. From that point on,
each RAFT log that is sent to the coordinator is also stored on disk. For every new coordinator instance, the server config is updated. Logs are created 
for each user action and failover action. Snapshots are created every N (N currently being 5) logs. 


### Restart of coordinator 

In case of coordinator's failure, on the restart, it will read information about other coordinators stored under `high_availability/raft_data/network` directory. 

From the `network` directory we will recover the server state before the coordinator stopped, including the current term, for whom the coordinator voted, and whether 
election timer is allowed.

It will also recover the following server config information: 
- other servers, including their endpoints, id, and auxiliary data
- ID of the previous log 
- ID of the current log 
- additional data needed by nuRaft

If durability is not disabled, the following information will be recovered from a common RocksDB `logs` instance: 
- current version of `logs` durability store 
- snapshots found with `snapshot_id_` prefix in database:
  - coordinator cluster state - all data instances with their role (MAIN or REPLICA), UUID of MAIN instance which REPLICA is listening to 
  - last log idx
  - last log term
  - last cluster config
- logs found in the interval between the start index and the last log index 
  - data - each log holds data on what has changed since the last state
  - term - nuRAFT term 
  - log type - nuRAFT log type


### Handling of durability errors 

If snapshots are not stored, an exception is thrown and left for the nuRAFT library to handle the issue. Logs can be missed and not stored since they are compacted and deleted
every two snapshots and will be removed relatively fast. In case the log is missing on recovery, the coordinator will not start. In that case, it is best to start 
a coordinator without durability and leave other coordinators to send missing data. Users are advised to use the same strategy in case a snapshot is missing on one 
of the coordinators. 

Memgraph throws an error in case of failure to store cluster config, which is updated in the `high_availability/raft_data/network` folder. 
If this happens, it will happen only on the first cluster start when coordinators are connecting since 
coordinators are configured only once at the start of the whole cluster. This is a non-recoverable error since in case the coordinator rejoins the cluster and has 
the wrong state of other clusters, it can become a leader without being connected to other coordinators. 


## Recovering from errors

Distributed systems can fail in numerous ways. With the current implementation, Memgraph instances are resilient to occasional network
failures and independent machine failures. Byzantine failures aren't handled since the Raft consensus protocol cannot deal with them either. 

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is an often used term for measuring the maximum tolerable length of time that an instance or cluster can be down.
Since every highly available Memgraph cluster has two types of instances, we need to analyze the failures of each separately.

Raft is a quorum-based protocol and it needs a majority of instances alive in order to stay functional. Hence, with just one coordinator instance down, RTO is 0 since
the cluster stays available. With 2+ coordinator instances down
(in a cluster with RF = 3), the RTO depends on the time needed for instances to come back.

Failure of REPLICA data instance isn't very harmful since users can continue writing to MAIN data instance while reading from MAIN or other
REPLICAs. The most important thing to analyze is what happens when MAIN gets down. In that case, the leader coordinator uses 
user-controllable parameters related to the frequency of health checks from the leader to replication instances (`--instance-health-check-frequency-sec`) 
and the time needed to realize the instance is down (`--instance-down-timeout-sec`). After collecting enough evidence, the leader concludes the MAIN is down and performs failover
using just a handful of RPC messages (correct time depends on the distance between instances). It is important to mention that the whole failover is performed with a zero data-loss 
if the newly chosen MAIN (previously REPLICA) had all up-to-date data.

Current deployment assumes the existence of only one datacenter, which automatically means that Memgraph won't be available in the case the whole datacenter goes down. We are actively
working on 2 datacenter (2-DC) architecture.

## Raft configuration parameters

Several Raft-related parameters are important for the correct functioning of the cluster. The leader coordinator sends a heartbeat
message to other coordinators every second to determine their health. This configuration option is connected with leader election timeout which
is a randomized value from the interval [2000ms, 4000ms] and which is used by followers to decide when to trigger new election process. Leadership
expiration is set to 2000ms so that cluster can never get into situation where multiple leaders exist. These specific values give a cluster
the ability to survive occasional network hiccups without triggering leadership changes.


## Kubernetes

We support deploying Memgraph HA instances as part of the Kubernetes cluster. 
You can see example configurations [here](/getting-started/install-memgraph/kubernetes#helm-chart-for-memgraph-high-availability-cluster).

## Docker Compose

The following example shows you how to setup Memgraph cluster using docker compose. The cluster will use user-defined bridge network.

License file `license.cypherl` should be in the format:

```

SET DATABASE SETTING 'organization.name' TO '<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME>';
SET DATABASE SETTING 'enterprise.license' TO '<YOUR_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE>';

```

You can directly use initialization file `HA_register.cypherl`:

```

ADD COORDINATOR 2 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "coord2:7692", "coordinator_server": "coord2:10112", "management_server": "coord2:12122"};
ADD COORDINATOR 3 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "coord3:7693", "coordinator_server": "coord3:10113", "management_server": "coord3:12123"};

REGISTER INSTANCE instance_1 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "instance1:7687", "management_server": "instance1:13011", "replication_server": "instance1:10001"};
REGISTER INSTANCE instance_2 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "instance2:7688", "management_server": "instance2:13012", "replication_server": "instance2:10002"};
REGISTER INSTANCE instance_3 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "instance3:7689", "management_server": "instance3:13013", "replication_server": "instance3:10003"};
SET INSTANCE instance_3 TO MAIN;

```

You can directly use the following `docker-compose.yml` to start the cluster using `docker compose up`:

Cluster can be shut-down using `docker compose down`.

## Manual Docker setup

This example will show how to set up a highly available cluster in Memgraph using three coordinators and 3 data instances.

<Steps>

### Start all instances

1. Start coordinator1:
```plaintext
docker run  --name coord1 --network=host -p 7691:7691 -p 7444:7444 -v mg_lib1:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_log1:/var/log/memgraph -e MEMGRAPH_ORGANIZATION_NAME=<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME> -e MEMGRAPH_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE="<YOUR ENTERPRISE LICENSE>"  memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7691 --log-level=TRACE --also-log-to-stderr --coordinator-id=1 --coordinator-port=10111 --management-port=12121--coordinator-hostname=localhost --nuraft-log-file=/var/log/memgraph/nuraft
```

2. Start coordinator2:
```plaintext
docker run  --name coord2 --network=host -p 7692:7692 -p 7445:7444 -v mg_lib2:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_log2:/var/log/memgraph -e MEMGRAPH_ORGANIZATION_NAME=<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME> -e MEMGRAPH_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE="<YOUR ENTERPRISE LICENSE>" memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7692 --log-level=TRACE --also-log-to-stderr --coordinator-id=2 --coordinator-port=10112 --management-port=12122--coordinator-hostname=localhost --nuraft-log-file=/var/log/memgraph/nuraft
```

3. Start coordinator3:
```plaintext
docker run  --name coord3 --network=host -p 7693:7693 -p 7446:7444 -v mg_lib3:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_log3:/var/log/memgraph -e MEMGRAPH_ORGANIZATION_NAME=<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME> -e MEMGRAPH_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE="<YOUR ENTERPRISE LICENSE>" memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7693 --log-level=TRACE --also-log-to-stderr --coordinator-id=3 --coordinator-port=10113 --management-port=12123--coordinator-hostname=localhost --nuraft-log-file=/var/log/memgraph/nuraft
```

4. Start instance1:
```plaintext
docker run  --name instance1 --network=host -p 7687:7687 -p 7447:7444 -v mg_lib4:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_log4:/var/log/memgraph -e MEMGRAPH_ORGANIZATION_NAME=<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME> -e MEMGRAPH_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE="<YOUR ENTERPRISE LICENSE>" memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE --also-log-to-stderr --management-port=13011--data-recovery-on-startup=true
```

5. Start instance2:
```plaintext
docker run --name instance2 --network=host -p 7688:7688 -p 7448:7444 -v mg_lib5:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_log5:/var/log/memgraph -e MEMGRAPH_ORGANIZATION_NAME=<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME> -e MEMGRAPH_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE="<YOUR ENTERPRISE LICENSE>" memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7688 --log-level=TRACE --also-log-to-stderr --management-port=13012--data-recovery-on-startup=true
```

6. Start instance3:
```plaintext
docker run --name instance3 --network=host -p 7689:7689 -p 7449:7444 -v mg_lib6:/var/lib/memgraph -v mg_log6:/var/log/memgraph -e MEMGRAPH_ORGANIZATION_NAME=<YOUR ORGANIZATION NAME> -e MEMGRAPH_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE="<YOUR ENTERPRISE LICENSE>" memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7689 --log-level=TRACE --also-log-to-stderr --management-port=13013--data-recovery-on-startup=true
```

### Register instances

1. Start communication with any Memgraph client on any coordinator. Here we chose coordinator 1.
```plaintext
mgconsole --port=7691
```
2. Connect the other two coordinator instances to the cluster.

```plaintext
ADD COORDINATOR 2 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "localhost:7692", "coordinator_server": "localhost:10112", "management_server": "localhost:12122"};
ADD COORDINATOR 3 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "localhost:7693", "coordinator_server": "localhost:10113", "management_server": "localhost:12123"};
```

3. Register 3 data instances as part of the cluster:

<Callout type="info">

Replace `<ip_address>` with the container's IP address. This is necessary for Docker deployments where instances are not on the local host.

</Callout>

```plaintext
REGISTER INSTANCE instance_1 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "localhost:7687", "management_server": "localhost:13011", "replication_server": "localhost:10001"};
REGISTER INSTANCE instance_2 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "localhost:7688", "management_server": "localhost:13012", "replication_server": "localhost:10002"};
REGISTER INSTANCE instance_3 WITH CONFIG {"bolt_server": "localhost:7689", "management_server": "localhost:13013", "replication_server": "localhost:10003"};
```

4. Set instance_3 as MAIN:
  
```plaintext
SET INSTANCE instance_3 TO MAIN;
```

5. Connect to the leader coordinator and check cluster state with `SHOW INSTANCES`;

| name          | bolt_server    | coordinator_server | management_server | health | role     | last_succ_resp_ms |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------  |
| coordinator_1 | localhost:7691 | localhost:10111    | localhost:12121   | up     | leader   |  0                |
| coordinator_2 | localhost:7692 | localhost:10112    | localhost:12122   | up     | follower |  16               |
| coordinator_3 | localhost:7693 | localhost:10113    | localhost:12123   | up     | follower |  25               |
| instance_1    | localhost:7687 |       ""           | localhost:13011   | up     | replica  |  39               |
| instance_2    | localhost:7688 |       ""           | localhost:13012   | up     | replica  |  21               |
| instance_3    | localhost:7689 |       ""           | localhost:13013   | up     | main     |  91               |

### Check automatic failover

Let's say that the current MAIN instance is down for some reason. After `--instance-down-timeout-sec` seconds, the coordinator will realize
that and automatically promote the first alive REPLICA to become the new MAIN. The output of running `SHOW INSTANCES` on the leader coordinator could then look like:

| name          | bolt_server    | coordinator_server | management_server | health | role     | last_succ_resp_ms |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------|
| coordinator_1 | localhost:7691 | localhost:10111    | localhost:12121   | up     | leader   |  0                |
| coordinator_2 | localhost:7692 | localhost:10112    | localhost:12122   | up     | follower |  34               |
| coordinator_3 | localhost:7693 | localhost:10113    | localhost:12123   | up     | follower |  28               |
| instance_1    | localhost:7687 |       ""           | localhost:13011   | up     | main     |  61               |
| instance_2    | localhost:7688 |       ""           | localhost:13012   | up     | replica  |  74               |
| instance_3    | localhost:7689 |       ""           | localhost:13013   | down   | unknown  |  71222            |
