# Setup high availability cluster with Docker Compose (Enterprise)

## Docker Compose

The following example shows you how to setup Memgraph cluster using Docker Compose.
The cluster will use user-defined bridge network.

<Callout>

**In production, it is always advised to run each instance on its dedicated server.** The setup however is
very similar. Make sure that the IPs of the machines are accessible inside the cluster in order to do proper
registration of the cluster.

</Callout>

<Steps>

### Start the Docker Compose

You can directly use the following `docker-compose.yml` to start the cluster using `docker compose up`.
The only thing you need to modify is put your license organization name, and the enterprise key.

### Validate license is correctly set

All the following queries can be run by querying directly coordinator 1, which we can conventionally
assume to be the leader for the cluster.

First, let's validate that the license has been correctly set, by executing the following query:

```
SHOW LICENSE INFO;
```

```nocopy
```

### Register the coordinator instances

Next, we proceed first by registering all the coordinators in the cluster.

The following query is a self-registration of coordinator 1, which also needs to be executed:
```
ADD COORDINATOR 1 WITH CONFIG {
  "bolt_server": "localhost:7691",
  "coordinator_server": "coord1:10111",
  "management_server": "coord1:12121"
};
```

Next up, we register the two other coordinators in the cluster:
```
ADD COORDINATOR 2 WITH CONFIG {
  "bolt_server": "localhost:7692",
  "coordinator_server": "coord2:10112",
  "management_server": "coord2:12122"
};
ADD COORDINATOR 3 WITH CONFIG {
  "bolt_server": "localhost:7693", 
  "coordinator_server": "coord3:10113", 
  "management_server": "coord3:12123"
};
```

We can see the state of the cluster by executing the following query:
```
SHOW INSTANCES
```

```nocopy
```

We observe that there is indeed one leader and two followers in the cluster:

### Register the data instances

We continue by registering the 3 data instances:
```
REGISTER INSTANCE instance_1 WITH CONFIG {
  "bolt_server": "localhost:7687", 
  "management_server": "instance1:13011", 
  "replication_server": "instance1:10001"
};
REGISTER INSTANCE instance_2 WITH CONFIG {
  "bolt_server": "localhost:7688",
  "management_server": "instance2:13012",
  "replication_server": "instance2:10002"
};
REGISTER INSTANCE instance_3 WITH CONFIG {
  "bolt_server": "localhost:7689",
  "management_server": "instance3:13013",
  "replication_server": "instance3:10003"
};
```

### Setup one of the instances as MAIN

We promote one of the instances as MAIN. The rest of them will serve as REPLICAs.

```
SET INSTANCE instance_3 TO main;
```

### Observe the state of the cluster

By issuing again the command:

```
SHOW INSTANCES;
```

We can observe that there is indeed one MAIN instance and 2 REPLICA instances:

```nocopy
```

Since the host can't resolve the IP for coordinators and data instances, Bolt
servers in Docker Compose setup require `bolt_server` set to `localhost:<port>`.

Cluster can be shut-down using `docker compose down`.
