# Memgraph's AI Ecosystem

GenAI applications are growing in popularity, and graph databases play a
critical role in enhancing their capabilities. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems often fall short when retrieving crucial knowledge from
complex datasets. This is where GraphRAG excels. By using a graph-based approach
to retrieval, GenAI applications can access more structured, contextually rich,
and relational data, leading to better performance, more accurate generation,
and richer insights.

## GraphRAG with Memgraph

Transforming unstructured data into actionable knowledge with Memgraph can be
achieved in just a few steps. 

[NICE IMAGE]

The starting point is usually a set of unstructured data. To convert such
unstructured data into a knowledge graph, use the
[R2R](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R) (RAG to Riches) library. R2R will gather
knowledge from the data, transform it into a graph and store it in Memgraph.

Once the data is in Memgraph, start a conversation with the
[GraphChat](/data-visualization/user-manual/graphchat) in Memgraph Lab.

## Integrations

To customize and build your own GenAI application from scratch, Memgraph offers
several integrations with popular AI libraries. Below are some of the essential
libraries integrated with Memgraph:

### R2R

A bit about this integration + example or link to example.

1. Build a KG
2. Query with natural language

### LangChain

A bit about this integration + example or link to example.

1. Build a KG (graph.add_graph_documents(graph_documents_props))
2. Query with natural language

### LlamaIndex

A bit about this integration + example or link to example.

1. Build a KG (KnowledgeGraphIndex.from_documents())
2. Query with natural language

## Key Memgraph features

There are several features in Memgraph that made it all possible.

- With the SHOW SCHEMA INFO query...
- By grounding the LLM model to always generate valid Cypher queries in Memgraph dialect...
- You can utilize Leiden community detection for ...
