# Memgraph's AI Ecosystem

GenAI applications are growing in popularity, and graph databases play a
critical role in enhancing their capabilities. Traditional Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems often fall short when retrieving crucial knowledge from
complex datasets. This is where GraphRAG excels. By using a graph-based or
hybrid approach to retrieval, GenAI applications can access more structured,
contextually rich, and relational data, leading to better performance, more
accurate generation, and richer insights.

## GraphRAG with Memgraph

LLMs have the knowledge they were trained on. By building a RAG, you're
exapanding that knowledge with your data. It is important to understand how to
**structure and model** the data and how to **find and extract relevant
information** for LLM to provide more accurate responses personalized to your
specific data.

**GraphRAG is a RAG system that combines the strengths of knowledge graphs and
LLMs**. Knowledge graphs are a structured representation of information where
entities and their relationships are organized to enable reasonings and
insights.

Here are the main strengths of a graph:
- **Relational context** - Knowledge graph structure holds the information about
  semantics.
- **Improved retrieval accuracy** - Having the retrieval strategies specific to
  graphs, such as community detection and impact analytics.
- **Multi-hop reasoning** - Ability to traverse through data neighbourhoods.
- **Efficient information navigation** - Scanning subgraph instead of full
  datasets.
- **Dynamically evolving knowledge** - Updating graph in real time.

Having a graph structure is a prerequisite for GraphRAG, and having a graph
database is even better. A GraphRAG application running in production needs
**scalability**, **real-time perfomance**, **incremental updates** and
**persistence**. Having a graph database as a part of the GraphRAG is especially
useful if other parts of the application also rely on the graph database.


### Key Memgraph features

There are several features in Memgraph that are useful when building a GraphRAG:

- [Louvain community detection](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/community_detection) 
- [Dynamic community detection](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/community_detection_online)
- [PageRank](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/pagerank)
- [Dynamic PageRank](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/pagerank_online)
- [Deep-path traversals](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal)
- [Text search](/querying/text-search)

And here is how those features fit into the GraphRAG architecture:

{<h4>Coming soon</h4>}

Two new important features for building a GraphRAG with Memgraph will be out in
the next release, Memgraph 2.21, in early November:

- **Vector search** - Usually used in the first step of finding and extracting
  relevant information (pivot search).
- **Leiden community detection** - Proven to be a better version of Louvain
  community detection, guaranteeing that all nodes within a community are
  connected. It is usually used in the second step of finding and extracting
  relevant information (relevance expansion).

### Integrations

To customize and build your own GenAI application from scratch, Memgraph offers
several integrations with popular AI libraries. Below are some of the essential
libraries integrated with Memgraph:

## Machine learning

Memgraph has been a popular choice in the AI world for a while now, especially
for the use cases around machine learning (ML). The MAGE library aims to provide
the most commonly used graph algorithms and that includes [graph ML
algorithms](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms#graph-ml-algorithms) as
well. 

### Node embeddings

Supervised machine learning is a subset of ML where algorithms try to learn from
data. Modeling the interactions between entities as graphs has enabled
researchers to understand the various networks in a systematic manner. For the
computer to understand these networks, it is necessary to embed a large graph in
low dimensional space, that is, node embeddings. It has been demonstrated that
graph embedding is superior to alternatives in many supervised learning tasks,
such as **node classification** and **link prediction**, usually used for
friendship or content recommendations, as well as for advertisement.

### Graph neural networks

Using node2vec algorithm to determine node embeddings works well, but it is less
precise than graph neural networks (GNNs). The goal of GNNs is to get the node
representations automatically and efficiently by iteratively aggregating the
representations of node neighbors and combining them with their representation
from the previous iteration. GNNs can inductively learn about your dataset,
which means that after training is complete, you can apply their knowledge to a
similar use case, meaning you don't have to retrain the whole algorithm.
