# Memgraph's AI ecosystem

AI drives a wide range of innovations, from machine learning (ML) models to
natural language processing (NLP) systems and beyond. These technologies
frequently intersect, enabling the creation of powerful applications with
Generative AI (GenAI), including advanced chatbots and agents.

## What You'll Find Here

This section of Memgraph’s documentation is your guide to using Memgraph for AI:

- [Building GenAI apps with GraphRAG](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag): See how knowledge graphs enable more
  efficient and scalable RAG systems.
- [AI integrations with Memgraph](/ai-ecosystem/integrations): We have several integrations with popular
  AI frameworks to help you customize and build your own GenAI application from
  scratch. Some of the libraries that support Memgraph
  include **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex**.
- [GraphChat in Memgraph Lab](/ai-ecosystem/graphchat): Explore how natural language querying
  (GraphChat) ties into the GraphRAG ecosystem, making complex graphs accessible
  to everyone.
- [Machine learning with Memgraph](/ai-ecosystem/machine-learning): Learn how Memgraph powers ML workflows
  with graph-powered insights.
