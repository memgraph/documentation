# Deployment

Whether you're getting started with best practices, optimizing for specific
workloads, or fine-tuning performance, this section brings together everything
you need to run Memgraph effectively in production. Explore tailored deployment
guides, environment-specific instructions, and benchmarking strategies to ensure
your graph applications scale reliably and efficiently.

## [Best practices](/deployment/best-practices)

Discover universal best practices for running Memgraph in production. This
foundational guide covers configuration, monitoring, and scaling — it's the
ideal starting point before diving into specific use cases.

## [Workloads](/deployment/workloads)

Explore in-depth guides tailored to specific workloads and use cases. These
resources help you adapt Memgraph for high-throughput systems, AI-driven
applications, and more.

### [Memgraph in high-throughput workloads](/deployment/workloads/memgraph-in-high-throughput-workloads)
Optimize Memgraph to handle rapid data ingestion and frequent updates while
maintaining performance and consistency in high-velocity environments.

### [Memgraph in GraphRAG use cases](/deployment/workloads/memgraph-in-graphrag)
Learn how to power Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by combining
large language models with graph-structured memory for more contextual and
accurate responses.

## [Environments](/deployment/environments)

Choose the deployment method that fits your stack — whether it's containerized
with Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes, or installed directly on Linux. This
section helps you set up Memgraph in any environment with ease.

## [Benchmarking](/deployment/benchmarking-memgraph)

Get hands-on with benchmarking strategies to evaluate Memgraph’s performance.
This guide walks through stress testing, analyzing key metrics, and comparing
real-world workloads to ensure scalability and responsiveness.
