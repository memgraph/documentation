# Deployment

Deploy Memgraph using methods that suit your environment, whether it's containerized with Docker or a native Linux installation.

## Docker deployment

Deploy Memgraph in a [Docker environment](/deployment/docker). Learn how to
install and run Memgraph using Docker images (`memgraph/memgraph-mage` or
`memgraph/memgraph`). Configure Memgraph through the `memgraph.conf` file or
Docker command flags, secure the database with user credentials and SSL, and
ensure data persistence with Docker volumes. Backup and restore data
efficiently, set up a replication cluster for high availability, and manage logs
for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

## Native Linux deployment

Install Memgraph directly on a [Linux system](/deployment/linux). Follow steps
to download and install Memgraph, connect using `mgconsole` or client libraries,
and configure settings via the `memgraph.conf` file. Secure your database with
user management and SSL encryption. Ensure data persistence by managing data
directories, and perform backups and restores. Set up a replication cluster for
improved data availability and monitor logs for system insights.

## AWS deployment

Deploy Memgraph on [AWS](/deployment/aws). Learn how to launch Memgraph using
Amazon EC2 instances and how to configure instance settings for optimal
performance.

## GCP deployment

Deploy Memgraph on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/deployment/gcp). Follow
instructions to set up Memgraph on Google Compute Engine nad how to configure VM
instances.

## Azure deployment

Deploy Memgraph on [Microsoft Azure](/deployment/azure). Discover how to deploy
Memgraph using Azure Virtual Machines and how to configure storage and
networking settings.
