# Deployment

Whether you're getting started with best practices, optimizing for specific
workloads, or fine-tuning performance, this section brings together everything
you need to run Memgraph effectively in production. Explore tailored [deployment
guides](#deployment-guides), [environment-specific instructions](#environments),
and [benchmarking strategies](#benchmarking) to ensure your graph applications
scale reliably and efficiently.

## Deployment guides

To simplify running Memgraph in a production environment, we’ve created a series
of guides to walk you through the process. **For the best results, follow them in
this order**:

1. **Begin with the [Deployment best practices guide](/deployment/best-practices)**.
   It outlines general best practices that apply to most production setups,
   regardless of workload type or specific use case.

2. **Then, go to the [Workloads](/deployment/workloads) section**. Each guide there
   focuses on a specific workload or deployment scenario. At the start of each
   guide, you'll find information on when that scenario is a good fit for your
   needs, along with tailored recommendations.

## [Environments](/deployment/environments)

Learn how to deploy Memgraph using methods that suit your environment, whether
it’s containerized with Docker or a native Linux installation.

## [Benchmarking](/deployment/benchmarking-memgraph)

Get hands-on with benchmarking strategies to evaluate Memgraph’s performance.
This guide walks through stress testing, analyzing key metrics, and comparing
real-world workloads to ensure scalability and responsiveness.
