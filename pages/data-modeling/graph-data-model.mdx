# Graph data model

This page will walk you through the fundamentals of graph databases, their
advantages over traditional databases, common use cases, and good practices for
designing an optimal graph schema. Whether you're exploring graph databases for
the first time or looking to refine your data modeling approach, you’ll find
valuable insights on how to leverage the power of graph technology for efficient
and scalable data analysis.

## What is a graph database?

A **graph database** is a database designed to store and manage data as a
network of **nodes** (entities) and **relationships** (connections). Unlike
traditional relational databases, where relationships are inferred
through **joins**, graph databases store relationships as **first-class
citizens**, enabling efficient traversal and querying.

Graph databases use graph theory principles to structure data, making them ideal
for representing highly connected information. By storing data in this
format, queries become more intuitive, and retrieval speeds improve, especially
in scenarios where relationships drive insights.

### Why use a graph database?

Graph databases are optimized for **relationship-heavy** data structures, where
connections between entities are as important as the entities themselves. Unlike
relational databases, which require complex JOIN operations to connect tables,
graph databases enable direct relationship traversal, leading to:

- **Faster queries** – Get results quickly even across multiple hops; directly
  linked data reduces both latency and cost compared to complex table joins.
- **Flexible schema** – Easily evolve your data model without migrations.
- **Scalability** – Handle dynamic, interconnected data efficiently.

### Common use cases

Graph databases power a wide range of applications that require fast, flexible,
and scalable data traversal. Some of the most common use cases include:

- [**Knowledge
  Graph**](/data-modeling/knowledge-graph): A knowledge
  graph structures and links information, making it easier to explore
  relationships between concepts. These are used in AI, semantic search,
  and context-aware applications like virtual assistants.
- **Social network analysis:** Graph databases naturally model social
  connections, making them ideal for community detection, influence analysis,
  friend recommendations.
- **Fraud detection:** Fraudsters often create complex, multi-hop schemes that
  are hard to detect in traditional databases. This makes then great for
  real-time anomaly detection by tracking unusual patterns and multihop
  relationship analysis to uncover hidden fraud networks.
- **Network and IT infrastructure management:** Managing complex computer
  networks, telecommunications systems, and IoT devices requires analyzing
  connectivity between devices, dependencies in network topologies, and failure
  points and bottlenecks.
- **Recommendation systems:** Graph databases enhance personalized
  recommendations by analyzing user behavior and preferences, similarities
  between products, content, or services, and real-time interactions and trends.
- **Supply chaing and logistics:** Graph-based supply chain management helps in
  tracking product flow from suppliers to customers, identifying
  vulnerabilities in the distribution network, and optimizing delivery
  routes for cost and efficiency.
- **Data lineage and management:** Graph databases help businesses track the
  flow of data across systems, making it easier to maintain data integrity,
  monitor data dependencies, and manage regulatory compliance.

## Labeled Property Graph (LPG)

Memgraph implements the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model, a flexible and
powerful way to structure data. LPG represents data as a graph of **nodes**
(entities) and **relationships** (connections), both of which can have
properties—key-value pairs storing additional information. This structure
enables intuitive, high-performance queries without relying on complex joins, as
in relational databases.

### Graph Components

A graph consists of three core components: nodes, relationships, and labels.

<h4 className="custom-header">1. Nodes</h4>

Nodes represent **entities** in your dataset. Each node can belong to one or
multiple **labels**, which act as categories or types. Labels help define
the **role and grouping** of nodes within the graph.

![graph-modeling-nodes](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/graph-modeling-nodes.png)

For example:

```cypher
(:Person:Student {name: "Alice", age: 20})
(:Person:Teacher {name: "Mr. Smith", experience: 10})
(:Subject {name: "Mathematics"})
```

Here, Alice is a `Person` node with the additional label `Student`, while Mr. Smith is
a `Person` with the label `Teacher` and has a **property** for experience.
Mathematics is a `Subject` node.

<h4 className="custom-header">2. Relationships</h4>

Relationships define connections between nodes. They are directed, meaning they
always have a start node and an end node, but queries can traverse them in any
direction.

![graph-modeling-relationships](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/graph-modeling-relationships.png)

Example: 

```cypher
(:Person:Teacher {name: "Mr. Smith"})-[:TEACHES]->(:Subject {name: "Mathematics"})
(:Person:Student {name: "Alice"})-[:STUDIES {grade: "A"}]->(:Subject {name: "Mathematics"})
```

`TEACHES` links teachers to the subjects they teach and
`STUDIES` links students to the subjects they study and stores a grade property.

<h4 className="custom-header">3. Labels</h4>

Labels categorize nodes and make querying more efficient. A node can have
multiple labels, allowing for flexible classification.

| **Node** | **Label(s)** | **Properties** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Person:Student` | `Person, Student` | `name, dateOfBirth, yearOfStudy` |
| `Person:Teacher` | `Person, Teacher` | `name, email, age` |
| `Subject` | `Subject` | `name` |

![graph-modeling-labels](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/graph-modeling-labels.png)

Using multiple labels, allows for queries such as: 

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person:Student) RETURN p.name;
```

<h4 className="custom-header">4. Properties</h4>

Both nodes and relationships can have properties, which store structured
data within the graph. Properties use key-value pairs and
store metadata inside nodes and relationships.

![graph-modeling-properties](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/graph-modeling-properties.png)

In the university example, the most relevant questions properties corresponding
to the answers would be:

- What are the names of the students, professors, and courses? - `name`
- How old are the students and the professors? - `dateOfBirth`, `age`
- What year of studies does the student attend? - `yearOfStudies`
- How to get in touch with the professor? - `email`

## Designing a graph database schema

Designing a graph database schema starts with defining what the database will be
used for. The requirements of your use case will determine the structure of your
graph, including the nodes, relationships, and properties, as well as the final
implementation.

A good practice is to start with a requirements document that outlines the goals
and the data your graph will manage. Unlike relational databases, graph
databases don't require a predefined schema. However, well-structured data
ensures efficient queries and optimized storage.

### Understanding the graph property model

The property graph model focuses on nodes (entities) and relationships
(connections) to explain how data is linked. A good graph model includes:

- Clear node labels to group similar entities.
- Well-defined relationships that describe how entities interact.
- Strategic use of properties (store data in relationships if it belongs to the
  connection itself).

Here’s an example scenario:

- ***Cities** like London and Paris are connected by **flights** and **roads**.*
- ***Distances** differ based on the mode of connection (340 km by flight and
  455 km by road).*
- *London is in **England** and connected to Liverpool and Leicester
  by **roads** (190 km distance).*
- *Paris is in **France** and connected to Lyon and Nice by **flights** (290 km
  distance).*

### Defining the requirements

Before structuring a graph, answer:

- **What entities exist in your domain?**
- **How do these entities interact?**
- **What properties should be stored, and where?**

It helps to have a requirements document that describes the domain.

Here’s an example: The language school offers courses taught
by teachers to clients and their employees. Employees (participants) may take
multiple courses, and each course is taught by one teacher. Courses are either
held at the client’s office or the school’s premises.

### Identifying nodes

Nodes represent the core entities in your domain. If an entity has a unique
identity, it’s likely a node.

From the language school scenario, the following **nouns** become
nodes: `Teacher`, `Course`, `Client`, `Participant`.

### Mapping relationships

Relationships define how nodes interact. They are typically **verbs** in the
requirements.

![graph-modeling-mapping-relationships](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/graph-modeling-mapping-relationships.png)

### Properties to store

Deciding whether to store a property inside a node or a relationship depends on
whether the data describes the **entity itself** or the **connection between
entities**. 

If the data describes the entity itself, it's usually the best to store it as a
node property. On the other hand, if the data describes connection between
entities, then it might be better to store it as a relationship property.

### Property vs. relationship

Deciding whether to model something as a property or a relationship is a common
question when working with labeled property graph models. While the rules are
generally straightforward, there are exceptions that depend on your data and use
case.

The key principle for this decision is limiting the scope of your searches to
ensure efficient queries and optimal performance. Searching
through properties for shared data can significantly increase memory usage and
reduce performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.

![graph-modeling-property-or-relationship](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/graph-modeling-property-or-relationship.png)

**When to use a property?** When you describe the entity or relationship itself
or when it’s unique or specific to the node/relationship and not shared across
multiple nodes.

```cypher
(:Product {name: "Milk", price: 2.99, expirationDate: "2024-01-01"})
```

Here, `price` and `expirationDate` are specific to the `Milk` product and make
sense as properties.

**When to use a relationship?** When the data connects entities and can be
shared across multiple nodes or when it’s queried frequently to find related
nodes or patterns. For example, in product categories.

Using a property:

```cypher
(:Product {name: "Milk", categories: ["Dairy", "Organic"]})
```

If you want to find other products in the same categories as `Milk`, you would
need to loop through the `categories` array for every node. This approach can
cause performance bottlenecks for large datasets.

Using a relationship:

```cypher
(:Product {name: "Milk"})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Category {name: "Dairy"})
(:Product {name: "Milk"})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Category {name: "Organic"})
```

This structure allows you to query related products easily:

```cypher
MATCH (:Product {name: "Milk"})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Category)<-[:BELONGS_TO]-(otherProducts:Product)
RETURN otherProducts.name
```

This approach avoids looping through properties and significantly improves
performance.

While relationships improve performance for shared data, they can make your
graph more complex and require additional memory. Consider the following:

- If a property is rarely queried or unique, it’s better to keep it as a
  property.
- If a property is shared across nodes or frequently queried, model it as a
  relationship.

<Callout type="warning"> 
**IMPORTANT**

Creating a new node—and a corresponding relationship—for every property
increases memory usage. If the property is shared across many nodes, it can
result in a **supernode**, which can negatively impact the performance and
scalability of your graph database. Avoid supernodes by carefully considering
how to model shared data.

## **Types of graphs**

There are some characteristics that define the type of graph. Here are some
basic types:

- **Undirected and Directed Graphs** - In an undirected graph, the relationships
  have no orientation. These relationships are sometimes referred to
  as **bi-directional**. The relationships in a directed graph have an
  orientation.

![graph-modeling-undirected-graph](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/graph-modeling-un-directed-graph.png)

- **Weighted And Unweighted Graphs** - A weighted graph has attributes on its
  relationships that specify their weight. For example, a relationship that
  represents the distance between two cities would have this distance stored as
  a relationship attribute. Unweighted graphs have no such relationship
  attributes and are sometimes referred to as **Non-Weighted Graphs**.

![graph-modeling-weighted-graph](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/graph-modeling-weighted-graph.png)

On top of direction and graph can also have a **self-loop** (also called a loop or a
buckle). Self-loop is a relationship that connects a node to itself,
while parallel relationships (also called multiple relationships or a
multi-relationship) are two or more relationships that are incident to the same
two nodes.

With a combination of mentioned characteristics and properties, you can create
different graphs:

- **Graph** - An undirected graph with self-loops.
- **DiGraph** - A directed graph with self-loops.
- **MultiGraph** - An undirected graph with self-loops and parallel
  relationships.
- **MultiDiGraph** - A directed graph with self-loops and parallel
  relationships.
