# Knowledge graph

From the business perspective, a knowledge graph (KG) represents how you organize and
represent your data. Hence, it encodes the knowledge about your use case, which
can be explored and fetched. Knowledge is encoded in the graph's structure in
the form of **nodes**, **relationships** and **properties**. 

From the operational and developer perspective, knowledge graphs represent just
a specific way of organizing and storing your data in the graph. Following
particular organization techniques, you can encode complex relationships between
different entities in your domain.

Knowledge graphs help developers to:

- **Understand complex relationships**: They reveal hidden patterns and
 connections between entities, which might not be obvious in traditional
 relational systems.
- **Enhance data discovery**: By representing data as a graph, traverse
 relationships and uncover new insights or trends in the data.
- [**Power AI applications**](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag): Knowledge graphs are foundational in
 building recommendation engines, semantic search systems, and various
 agent-driven applications,
 offering more context-aware and intelligent results.
- **Enable flexible querying**: Queries can be more dynamic and powerful,
 allowing for complex graph traversals and relationship-based searches that are
 harder to achieve with relational databases.


This guide will help you understand how to model the knowledge and [store it
into Memgraph](##storing-a-knowledge-graph-in-memgraph). With the
[example](#example) below, get a sense of basic concepts when modeling a
knowledge graph.


## Storing a knowledge graph in Memgraph

Memgraph is based on the [label property graph (LPG) model](/data-modeling),
which is one of the most flexible ways to describe the domain knowledge in the
graph format.

Resource Description Framework (RDF) is another popular way to model knowledge,
but it is more rigid and less flexible than LPG.

On top of being an LPG database, Memgraph is also a high-performance, in-memory
graph database that can handle complex queries and large datasets. It is
optimized for fast and [deep path
traversals](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal), which are essential for
knowledge graph applications.

To import your structured data into Memgraph, please follow the [import best
practices](/data-migration/best-practices).

In case you're dealing with unstructured data, you'll need a pipeline to
structure it to the appropriate model before importing it into Memgraph. You can
also try out one of our [integrations](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag#integrations)
with the popular AI frameworks for knowledge graph creation.

## Example

### Dataset

In this example we'll go through a process of knowledge graph creation for a
project management scenario. Let's assume you have a dataset that contains
information about people, their skills, the companies they work for, tasks they
need to do, tasks that are part of the project, and the project that the client
requests. So, you have a network of nodes and relationships representing data
without the added layer of meaning or semantics. Initially, this would be the
graph model: 

![Initial Graph
Model](/pages/data-modeling/knowledge-graph/project-management-graph.png)

The goal is to create a **knowledge graph** - a structured representation of
information where entities and their relationships are organized to enable
reasoning and insights.

The main purpose of having a knowledge graph is to get valuable insights from
data to improve the area of work you're dealing with. Another reason to have a
knowledge graph is to enable LLM to answer the question for you
([GraphRAG](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag)). In this project management example,
knowledge graph can help you with:

- Efficient Resource Allocation
- Project Planning and Tracking
- Skill Gap Analysis
- Improved Client Management
- Cross-domain expertise and Flexibility
- Cost Optimization

The focus of the knowledge graph could be to answer questions like: 

- Do people have sufficient skills to perform all the tasks they are working on?
- Are we able to execute all the projects?
- Do we have missing gaps in skills that we need to fill?
- Does the budget cover the cost of people with sufficient skills to work on
 that project?
- Do employees work on tasks that match their domain preferences?


### Answering questions without the knowledge graph

Let's start with the initial model we have in the database. 

To answer the question "Do people have sufficient skills to perform all the
tasks they are working on?", first come up with a Cypher query. For example,
match all the people that work on tasks, and then filter them by the necessary
skill to perform the task.

Here is how the query would look like:

```cypher 
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_ON]->(t:Task)
WHERE all(skill IN t.Skills WHERE skill IN p.Skills)
RETURN *;
```

It doesn't look like a complicated query, but a prerequisite to come up with it
is to know the structure of the graph - what skills represent the person and
task nodes, and how they are even correlated. The **knowledge is built into the
query instead of being encoded in the graph**.  

Cypher queries can become complex for complicated questions, but if you have a
set of predefined questions and someone who knows Cypher, it's possible to deal
with the graph as is by infering the knowledge from the graph model and writing
specific queries to answer specific questions.

Now imagine you decided to enable a software agent in the form of LLM to answer
the same question. 

One approach is to enrich the prompt for the LLM with the schema of the graph.
This approach has its limitations due to the size of LLM's context window. 

Another, and probably better approach would be to encode the knowledge into the
graph. LLM then needs to find a part of the graph to focus on, based on the
question asked, and expand the relevant context further by traversing across the
graph. In GraphRAG terms, you need to find a **pivot point** and perform
**relevance expansion**. Pivot point is usually found by performing **vector
search** - finding nodes in the graph most similar to the question which is
embedded in the same space. The relevance expansion is the process of expanding
the data around the pivot point and providing additional relevant context to the
LLM model to ground it. For example, the relevance expansion can be done by
performing two hops in the graph from the pivot point. Learn more about these
terms in our [GraphRAG docs](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag).

### Encoding knowledge into the graph

Based on the previous example, it is all about skills, relationships with
employees, and tasks. In order to improve a graph ontology, the skill needs to
become a class, or node in this case. 

The improved graph model looks like this:

![Improved knowledge
graph](/pages/data-modeling/knowledge-graph/project-management-progression-graph.png)

Now the knowledge about skills and how they're related to people and tasks is
encoded into the graph model.

Notice how the relationships `HAS` between `Person` and `Skill` and the
relationship `NEEDS` between `Task` and `Skill` are now semantically describing
the relationship's meaning. You can basically read sentences from the graph
model.

Here is the updated Cypher query that answers the question "Do people have
sufficient skills to perform all the tasks they are working on?" based on the
new graph model: 

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[h:HAS]->(s:Skill)<-[n:NEEDS]-(t:Task)
WHERE exists((p)-[:WORKS_ON]->(t))
RETURN *
```

Here is the query that answers the question "Which people don't have sufficient skills to perform the tasks they
are working on?":

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[w:WORKS_ON]->(t:Task)-[n:NEEDS]->(s:Skill)
WHERE NOT exists((p)-[:HAS]->(s))
RETURN *
```

Although you still need to write the query to fetch the data, the query uses
graph structure and has the semantics of the graph model. That can be used to
infer knowledge from the graph and more easily find the answers to questions
that were not even defined in the first place.

### Knowledge graph creation

The process of encoding the knowledge includes modeling the graph to represent
the domain knowledge accurately. There is no a one-size-fits-all approach to
modeling a knowledge graph, as it depends on the specific use case and the
questions you want to answer.

In general, you want to extract all the entities and relationships that are
relevant to your domain and represent them as nodes and relationships in the
graph. This often means pulling out node properties and relationships from the
data and creating a graph schema that captures their connections.

Here is a complete graph model from the previous example that will help answer
more domain questions: 

![Complete knowledge
graph](/pages/data-modeling/knowledge-graph/project-management-full-graph.png)

Notice how the graph model grew - from four node labels and three relationship
types to six node labels and nine relationship types - and all with same data.
This graph model is more complex and semantically rich, and it can be used to
answer more complicated questions about the project management scenario. Even just
by glancing at the model, you have a better understanding of what is happening. 

Now it's possible to answer this question: "For all the projects, do we have
gaps in skills missing?". Without writing the query, it should be clear from the
graph model how to answer it. 

Here is the query: 

```cypher
MATCH (p:Project)-[:REQUIRES]->(s:Skill)
OPTIONAL MATCH (person:Person)-[:HAS]->(s)
WITH p, s, collect(person) AS peopleWithSkill
WHERE size(peopleWithSkill) = 0
RETURN p.name AS UnfulfillableProject, collect(s.name) AS MissingSkills;
```

In the example dataset, there is a project that requires a skill that no one in
the company has. This is the result of the above query:

```
+----------------------+----------------------+
| UnfulfillableProject | MissingSkills        |
+----------------------+----------------------+
| "AI Integration"     | ["Machine Learning"] |
+----------------------+----------------------+
```

Although we again wrote the query to fetch the data, the knowledge about the
skills and projects is encoded into the graph model.

### Knowledge graphs and LLMs

By combining knowledge graphs with LLMs, you're creating a
[GraphRAG](/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag) system.

For GraphRAG, it is important that the underlying graph model really captures
the semantics of the business and questions needed to answer. There are various
pieces to the GraphRAG puzzle, as it combines knowledge graphs and LLMs, but one
way of improving the system is to plan how to model the knowledge graph properly
and to iterate until you get it right. 

To return back to the example, let's say LLM needs to answer the question "Are
we able to execute Data Preprocessing project?".

In the background, the question gets embedded, [vector
search](/querying/vector-search) is performed and pivot node is found. In this
case, the pivot node is `(:Project {name:"Data Preprocessing"})`. The next step
is relevance expansion, which is performed with the following query:

```cypher
MATCH path=(p:Project {name:"Data Preprocessing"})-[r *..2]-(n) RETURN path;
```

All that's returned is considered relevant information which is then forwarded
to the LLM within the prompt. 

Here is the example of the LLM response:

```plaintext

Project Overview

- Project Name: Data Preprocessing
 - Budget: $50,000
 - Start Date: 2024-10-01
 - End Date: 2024-11-30
 - Total Duration: 60 days

Tasks and Requirements

- Task Name: Data Cleaning
 - Description: Clean and preprocess raw data
 - Estimated Man-Days: 10 days
 - Required Skill: Data Analysis (inferred from the relationship)

Personnel Involved

- Person: Jane Smith
 - Cost per Day: $600
 - Skills: Data Analysis (inferred from the relationship)

Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the project does have a sufficient level of skilled
personnel to fulfill the requirements, as Jane Smith is qualified for the
necessary task. Additionally, the budget is adequate to cover her costs, with a
significant amount remaining for any additional needs or tasks that may arise.
```

If you look closely, the LLM has inferred knowledge from the knowledge graph.
Without even thinking about specific things you want to ask, it predicts what
the answer is based on the data in the knowledge graph.

Passing in the same data and asking the question: "Do employees work on tasks
and projects that match their domain preferences?"

Here is the response from the LLM:

```plaintext
Yes, it appears that people are working on tasks they are interested in:

Task Interest Alignment: Jane Smith, who is assigned to work on the "Data
Cleaning" task, has a preference for the Data Science domain, which is related
to this task. This alignment suggests she is working within an area of interest.

Skills and Preferences: Jane possesses the Data Analysis skill, which is also a
requirement for the project and a direct need for the "Data Cleaning" task. This
indicates that her skills and interests align with her assigned
responsibilities. 

This structure suggests that team members like Jane are indeed
working on tasks that match both their skills and their domain preferences,
which can enhance motivation and project outcomes.
