# Model a graph from CSV file

This guide will teach you how to model your existing data using dummy
data before importing your real data into Memgraph. By following the guide,
you’ll learn to create efficient, clean, and optimized graph models to maximize
performance.

<h3 className="custom-header">Who is this guide for?</h3>

This guide is designed for:

- Beginners or less experienced graph database users.
- Anyone unsure of how to model data or import it into Memgraph for maximum
  speed and efficiency.

<h3 className="custom-header">What you’ll need for this?</h3>

- Memgraph Platform installed. Quick start: for Linux/macOS run `curl
  https://install.memgraph.com | sh` and for Windows run `iwr
  https://windows.memgraph.com | iex`. Read detailed instructions
  in the [getting started guide](https://memgraph.com/docs/getting-started).
- A CSV file containing your data [stored in a running Memgraph container](/getting-started/first-steps-with-docker#copy-files-from-and-to-a-docker-container). For this guide, we provide a [dummy file with
  random
  data](https://public-assets.memgraph.com/import-data/data-modeling/random_data.csv).
- Basic knowledge of databases (helpful but not mandatory).

## Introduction to graph data modeling

**Data modeling** is key for the best performance and efficient use of storage
in any database. To get the most out of a database, you need to take advantage
of its specific strengths. In the case of graph databases, you use the graph
structure—nodes and relationships—so that you can avoid duplicating data
unnecessarily.

Think of nodes as **entities** in a relational database and relationships
as foreign keys. However, graph databases offer a key advantage: you can store
information directly on nodes, without repeating it in relationships.

For example, let's say you have a data on orders and workers. In a relational
database, you’d need to duplicate some of a worker’s details (e.g., name and
position) when connecting them to an order. But in a graph database:

- Worker details are stored on the `Worker` node.
- The relationship to the `Order` node only stores the order number.

By keeping your data model clean and efficient, you reduce storage costs, and
lower the total cost of ownership. 

<h3 className="custom-header">Overview of the dummy CSV file</h3>

This guide is designed to give you hands-on examples of how to model data in a
graph database. We’ll be working with data that represents one million randomly
generated individuals, each with properties like name, surname, age, and date of
birth. The data will be formatted in a CSV file, with each row representing one
individual. Here is how the header and the first couple of rows look like:

| Name     | Surname   | Age | Date_of_Birth |
|----------|----------|-----|--------------|
| Justin   | Diaz     | 18  | 2005-10-23   |
| Donald   | Jones    | 35  | 1989-02-28   |
| David    | Harvey   | 71  | 1953-04-29   |
| Timothy  | Morris   | 49  | 1975-06-05   |
| Gabriela | Moore    | 43  | 1981-03-30   |
| David    | Williams | 60  | 1964-03-06   |

Our goal is to show you how to:

1. Import this data into Memgraph.
2. Use it for analysis.
3. Apply techniques you learned to your own data.

If you'd like to skip the data modeling guide and head over to [querying the
dataset](#test-and-optimize-the-queries), run the [import Cypher
queries](#dataset-import-queries). 

## Analyze and break down data

To analyze and break down data, first open the file and inspect its structure.

**Objective:** Learn how to structure data as a graph by identifying:
- **Key entities:** What are the nodes in your data?
- **Connections:** What relationships link these entities?

**Example:** Treat the dummy data as a simplified version of users’ complex
data. Identify entities like `Person`and decide on potential relationships
(friendships, families, etc.).

The key question to ask yourself is: What do I want to achieve with my data, and
how should I model it to make that happen? 

For this guide, we’ll focus on modeling friendships. However, always tailor your
graph to highlight the value in your own data by thinking about expected inputs
and outputs. When doing the same on your data, approach it with this question:
“What are my key entities and how are they related?”

## Design your graph model

After analyzing and breaking down data, the next step is to design a preliminary
graph model using the dummy data. 

**Objective:** Transition from a flat file to a graph model by defining nodes
and relationships.

**Example:**
- **Nodes:** `Person` (with properties like name, surname, age, and date of
  birth).
- **Relationships:** `FRIENDS_WITH`, `CONNECTED_TO` or similar relationships
  representing the connection between different persons.

Moving on to transferring data into graph structure. As we mentioned earlier,
each **entity** will be represented as a **node**. In our example, we’ll call
these nodes `Person` nodes. Based on the data we have, each `Person` node will
have the following properties: name, surname, age, and date of birth.

Now that we know how to map entities to nodes, the next step is deciding what to
do with this data. This decision will depend on the specific use case. 

For instance, let’s assume that `Person` 1 is considered a friend of `Person` 2 if
they share the same birthdate. Defining these kinds of relationships early on is
crucial because knowing your goals in advance makes it easier to set everything
up correctly from the start.

Now that we’ve structured our data, it’s time to start working with Memgraph.

## Learn Cypher syntax with dummy data

To interact with Memgraph, it is important to learn the basics of [Cypher](/querying). 

**Objective**: Understand how to create nodes, relationships, and perform queries.

Memgraph uses the **Cypher query language** to interact with the database. While
there is a bit of a learning curve, you’ll find it helpful in the long run.
Cypher is easy to read and maintain, and it offers greater expressiveness
compared to traditional SQL.

<h3 className="custom-header">Creating nodes</h3>

To create a node in Memgraph, we use
the [`CREATE`](/querying/create-graph-objects#create) clause. For example, let’s
create a `Person` node:

```cypher
CREATE (:Person {name: 'John', surname: 'Doe', age: 30, date_of_birth: date('1990-01-01')});
```

Let’s break it down:
- The `()` syntax defines the node. `:Person` is the **label** we assign to the node. In a graph, you’ll have
  different types of entities, and labels help you distinguish between them.
- Inside the `{}` brackets, we define the **properties** of the node, which give
  more details about the entity. Properties are often used for analytics or
  filtering.
- **Cypher automatically handles data types** for you, so there’s no need to
  specify them -- Memgraph takes care of that.


<h3 className="custom-header">Creating relationships</h3>

To [create a
relationship](/querying/create-graph-objects#creating-relationships) between
nodes, we use this syntax:

```cypher
MATCH (p1:Person {name: 'John'}), (p2:Person {name: 'Jane'})
CREATE (p1)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2);
```

Here’s what’s happening:

- We first **match** two existing nodes (John and Jane) using their properties.
- The `CREATE` statement establishes a relationship between them.
- The `[:FRIENDS_WITH]->` syntax defines the relationship. The `[]` brackets
  indicate a relationship in Cypher, and `FRIENDS_WITH` is the **type** of relationship.

Try creating nodes for John and Jane and then establish a relationship between
them.

<h3 className="custom-header">Querying nodes</h3>

To search for a specific node, you can use the `MATCH` and `RETURN` keywords:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'John' RETURN p;
```

This will return all nodes where the `name` property is 'John'. You can also query
by other properties:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age > 30 RETURN p;
```

To return a specific property, such as the `name`, run the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age > 30
RETURN p.name;
```

Or if you want to know how many people named John exist in the database:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'John'
RETURN COUNT(p);
```

Cypher offers a lot of flexibility for [querying](/querying) your data. Try
different queries to get comfortable with all the possibilities.

<h3 className="custom-header">Advantages of graph relationships</h3>

A big advantage of using relationships between nodes is that you don’t need to
duplicate data. When you later search for relationships, Memgraph automatically
retrieves the connected nodes without needing to store redundant information.
This is a key difference from traditional SQL databases, where relationships
often require separate tables with duplicated data.

## Data import

The next step is to import the dummy CSV file into Memgraph using the [`LOAD
CSV`](/querying/clauses/load-csv) clause.

### Create indexes

In Memgraph, indexes are not created in advance and creating constraints does
not imply index creation. By creating label or label-property indexes,
relationships between nodes will be created much faster and consequently speed
up data import. A good rule of thumb is to create indexes for the label or label
and property being matched in Cypher queries. 

Indices are a great tool in Memgraph, particularly when dealing with large
datasets and frequent queries. Here's why:

- **Faster node lookup** - Label indices make it quicker to find nodes of a
  specific type.
- **Efficient Filtering** - Label-property indices improve the speed of filtering
  operations, especially on frequently queried properties like `name`.

For our example, it might be good to create the following indexes:

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Person;
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(name);
```

When running queries, it is good to filter data as much as possible. The most
common approach is to filter by label. Since all of our nodes are labeled with
`:Person`, this index is not that important. But, if you expand your database
and have various labels, indexing them will increase query performance
significantly. 

Later on, when creating relationships, we'll filter data by the `name` property
(name: "Cheryl" or name: "Jeanne"), and that's why we created such
label-property index. It will significantly speed up filtering, especially if
there are a lot of different names in the dataset. You can decide on which
indexes to create after you design the import queries.

### Create nodes

Next, let's create `Person` nodes.

**Objective:** Detect data that needs to be cleaned or transformed for proper
data import (e.g., convert strings to integers or dates).

In the dummy CSV file, the date of birth is stored as a string. Storing dates as
strings can be inefficient and hard to work with. This is where
Memgraph’s [temporal types](/fundamentals/data-types#temporal-types) come in. In
Cypher, you can transform a date string into a temporal object using
the `date()` function, which makes date comparisons easier and more efficient.

Here is an example of how a `Person` node can be created with a temporal date of birth:

```cypher
CREATE (:Person {
    name: 'Jane',
    surname: 'Smith',
    age: 25,
    date_of_birth: date('1995-05-10')
});
```

By storing the birthdate as a temporal type, `date_of_birth` field becomes an
object with separate fields for the year, month, and day, all stored as
integers. This makes date comparisons much simpler. 

Comparing dates is far more practical with temporal than string types. Here is
an example query that returns all `Person` nodes with a date of birth after
January 1, 1990:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person) 
WHERE p.date_of_birth > date('1990-01-01') RETURN p;
```

You can also make more granular comparisons. If you’re interested in finding all
people born on the 10th day of any month, use the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person) 
WHERE p.date_of_birth.day = 10 RETURN p;
```

Taking this into account, we'll use temporal data type for birthdate instead of
string and create nodes in Memgraph using the `LOAD CSV` clause. 

The following query will create 1M `Person` nodes from the provided
`random_data.csv` file:

```cypher
LOAD CSV FROM 'usr/lib/memgraph/random_data.csv' WITH HEADER AS row
CREATE (:Person {
    name: row.Name,
    surname: row.Surname,
    age: toInteger(row.Age),
    date_of_birth: date(row.Date_of_Birth)
});
```

Notice how we used `toInteger` function which will store the age as an integer,
instead of the default string. Having integer instead of string eases the future
comparisons.

<h4 className="custom-header">Inspect the created nodes</h4>

To verify the created nodes and visualize the results, run the following
query:

```cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN n
LIMIT 10;
```

![data-modeling-nodes](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/data-modeling-csv-nodes.png)

Here’s more information on the query:

1. `MATCH` clause:
    - Retrieves all nodes (`n`).
2. `RETURN` clause:
    - Returns all nodes (`n`).
3. `LIMIT` clause:
    - Displays only the first 10 nodes for simplicity and quick
      validation.

### Create relationships

The next step is to create relationships between the `Person` nodes based on
logical assumptions (e.g., people born in the same year could be considered
friends).

**Objective:** Learn how to model relationships by identifying
implicit or explicit connections.

Here is an example of a simple query that creates a relationship between two
people born on the same day:
```cypher
MATCH (p1:Person), (p2:Person) 
WHERE p1.date_of_birth = p2.date_of_birth
CREATE (p1)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2);
```

Here is another example of a query that identifies all pairs of nodes labeled
`Person` with the name "John" and creates a `FRIENDS_WITH` relationship between
them:

```cypher
MATCH (p1:Person {name: "John"}), (p2:Person {name: "John"})
WHERE p1 <> p2
WITH p1, p2
LIMIT 100000
CREATE (p1)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2);
```

To avoid self-loops, the query ensures that a node cannot create a
relationship with itself (`p1 <> p2`). Additionally, a `LIMIT` is applied to
restrict the total number of relationships created to 100,000.

After successfully importing `Person` nodes with the `LOAD CSV` clause and
interacting with them, it's time to create relationships between these nodes. In
this example, we will model friendships based on a simple rule: every Cherly
and Jeanne are considered friends.

There are 2,121 Cheryl and 245 Jeanne in the database. That means there are
519,645 pairs of Cheryl and Jeanne `Person` nodes in the database. We plan to
create `FRIENDS_WITH` relationship between every pair, meaning that we will
create 519,645 relationships. 

Here is a query to create all relationships:
```cypher
MATCH (p1:Person {name: "Cheryl"}), (p2:Person {name: "Jeanne"})
WITH p1, p2
MERGE (p1)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2);
```

Here’s more information:

1. `MATCH` clause:
    - Identifies two `Person` nodes from the graph and creates such pair (`p1`
      and `p2`). One node has property name Cheryl and another Jeanne. 
2. `WITH` clause
    - Passes the node pairs (`p1` and `p2`) to the next part of the query.
3. `MERGE` clause:
    - Establishes the `FRIENDS_WITH` relationship between the selected pairs,
      making sure that no new nodes are create (`CREATE` would create
      duplicates)

<h4 className="custom-header">Inspect the created relationships</h4>

To verify the created relationships and visualize the results, run the following
query:

```cypher
MATCH (n)-[r:FRIENDS_WITH]->(m)
RETURN n, r, m
LIMIT 10;
```

![data-modeling-rels](/pages/data-modeling/graph-modeling/data-modeling-csv-relationships.png)

Here’s more information on the query:

1. `MATCH` clause:
    - Retrieves all nodes (`n` and `m`) connected by the `FRIENDS_WITH`
      relationship.
2. `RETURN` clause:
    - Returns the starting node (`n`), the relationship (`r`), and the ending
      node (`m`) for inspection.
3. `LIMIT` clause:
    - Displays only the first 10 relationships for simplicity and quick
      validation.

This approach demonstrates how easy it is to build and explore relationships
within your graph database using Memgraph.


## Test and optimize queries

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you have imported the dataset before you try out the queries below. If
you want to import the data quickly, run the [import Cypher
queries](#dataset-import-queries). 
</Callout>
The goal now is to write and test queries on the dummy data to ensure
the best performance and structure.

**Objective:** Learn how to query efficiently and test if the re-modeled data
performs as expected in Memgraph.

When working with large datasets in Memgraph, even simple queries can benefit
significantly from optimization. Let’s walk through an example where we retrieve
all people older than 35 years from the graph and apply an optimization using
indices to improve query performance.

Here’s the initial query we used to retrieve all people with an `age` of 35 or
older:

```cypher
MATCH (p1:Person)
WHERE p1.age >= 35
RETURN p1;
```

Result:

- Number of nodes found: 792,750 `Person` nodes.
- Execution time: 2.7 seconds.

While this query is straightforward and correct, the execution time can be
optimized, especially when dealing with such a large dataset. Since the
bottleneck in this query comes from filtering the `Person` nodes by their `age`
property, adding an index on the `age` property will allow Memgraph to locate
matching nodes more efficiently.

To create the index, run the following query:

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(age);
```

Why indexing helps?

- **Faster filtering -** Without an index, Memgraph must scan through all nodes
  labeled `Person` to evaluate the `age` property for each one. Adding an index
  allows Memgraph to directly access nodes with the desired `age` range.
- **Scalability -** Indexing ensures that the query performs better as the
  dataset grows, making it a critical optimization for large-scale graphs.

After creating the index on the `age` property, we re-ran the same query:

```cypher
MATCH (p1:Person)
WHERE p1.age >= 35
RETURN p1;
```

Results:

- Execution time: 2.531 seconds.
- Improvement: Execution time was reduced by 6%.

Another step in the speed improvement is to return a specific property you're interested in, instead of the whole node object:
```cypher
MATCH (p1:Person)
WHERE p1.age >= 35
RETURN p1.name;
```

Results:

- Execution time: 1.514 seconds.
- Improvement: Execution time was reduced by additional 40%.

<Callout>
**PRO TIPS**
- Optimization on simple queries matters.
- Indexing is a low-cost, high-impact optimization.
- Return the subset of data you're interested in. 
</Callout>

## Dataset import queries

To create the database in Memgraph from the provided dummy data, run the Cypher
queries provided below. The prerequisite is to [copy the CSV file into the
container](/getting-started/first-steps-with-docker#copy-files-from-and-to-a-docker-container)
where Memgraph is running in the `usr/lib/memgraph` directory.

<details>
  <summary>**Cypher import queries**</summary>

  ```cypher
  CREATE INDEX ON :Person(name);
  CREATE INDEX ON :Person;

  LOAD CSV FROM 'usr/lib/memgraph/random_data.csv' WITH HEADER AS row
  CREATE (:Person {
      name: row.Name,
      surname: row.Surname,
      age: toInteger(row.Age),
      date_of_birth: date(row.Date_of_Birth)
  });

  MATCH (p1:Person {name: "Cheryl"}), (p2:Person {name: "Jeanne"})
  WITH p1, p2
  MERGE (p1)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2);
  ```
</details>
