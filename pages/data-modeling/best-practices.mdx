# Graph data modeling best practices

Modeling your data for a graph database like Memgraph can be incredibly
powerful, but it's easy to hit a few roadblocks if you're not careful. Whether
you're a newcomer to graph databases or transitioning from relational systems,
understanding common pitfalls and best practices will set you up for success.
Here’s a guide to help you avoid mistakes and design clean, efficient, and
performant graph models.

## Don't overcomplicate the model

It's tempting to model every last detail of your data as nodes and
relationships. But this can lead to a bloated graph structure that’s inefficient
and hard to maintain. Rather **stick to simple and direct relationships between
key entities**. Ask yourself: "Does this node or relationship add real value to my
model?" If the answer is no, leave it out. Focus on what matters most for your
use case.

## Avoid data duplication

Coming from a relational database background, you might feel the urge to
duplicate data—like adding redundant properties or repeating nodes—just as you
would with foreign keys and JOIN tables. This bloats your graph and wastes
resources. Instead of duplicating data, use relationships to connect nodes. For
example, instead of adding a worker’s information to every order, store it on a
single `Worker` node and link it to `Order` nodes with relationships. Graph
databases excel at representing relationships between entities. When building
your model, think about the connections in your data. How do your entities
interact? How can relationships help you query insights faster?

## Consider different data types

When modeling a graph in Memgraph, it's essential to optimize memory usage, as
Memgraph is an in-memory database. Choosing the right property data types, you
significantly **reduce resource consumption and improve performance**.

Use efficient data types such as integers where applicable. Booleans are another
lightweight data type that minimizes memory usage.

Optimize date and time storage by storing dates and times as **temporal data
type** as opposed to strings. For example, for the datetime
value: `"2021-10-05T14:15:00"`: if you store it as a string, it requires 1B per
character. With 19 characters + 3B overhead = 22B total memory. Now, if you
store it as a temporate type, it only takes up 15B of memory.

When working with properties that have repeated values,
use enums like `"Pending"`, `"Approved"`, `"Rejected"`instead of strings because
they take up less memory and are faster to compare, improving query performance.

Sometimes, using strings or integers to represent dates might seem
straightforward, but it limits your ability to query time-based data
efficiently. Use Memgraph’s built-in temporal data
types like `date` and `datetime`. These not only save storage space but also
allow for more expressive queries.

## To index or not

Forgetting to create indexes can make queries painfully slow, but over-indexing
can hurt write performance. Finding the right balance is crucial.

Only create indexes on properties that are frequently queried—like `name`, `id`,
or other search-critical fields. Avoid indexing every property unless it’s
absolutely necessary, and periodically review the effectiveness of your indexes
as your dataset grows.

## Switch to a graph way of thinking

Treating graph queries like SQL JOINs can lead to inefficient and overly complex
queries. A graph database isn’t a relational database, and graph traversals are
fundamentally different.

Think in terms of relationships and traversals. Instead of joining tables, focus
on exploring the connections between nodes. Traversals are intuitive and
designed for exploring networks—take advantage of this!

## Measure the performance of your queries

Building a great data model is one thing, but ignoring performance testing can
leave you with queries that are slow and inefficient when it matters most.
Run real-world test queries as you build your model. 

Memgraph executes queries based on the generated [query
plan](/querying/query-plan). Use the [PROFILE](/querying/clauses/profile) clause
to analyze query execution, understand the impact of each operator and identify
bottlenecks early on. It’s easier to fix performance issues in the design phase
than after deploying your graph. Changing a single operator in a query plan can
make a significant difference in data pipeline and query performance. To update
the query plan, update the graph model or
[index](/querying/best-practices#indexing) the data properly. 

## Final thoughts

By following these best practices, you’ll create a graph model that’s not only
efficient but also easy to maintain and scale. Always think critically about
your data, your goals, and how your graph model can help achieve them. If you
