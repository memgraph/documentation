# Experimental features

These features are actively being developed and may change or be removed in
future releases. Use them with caution in production environments and only if
you thoroughly understand their implications and are prepared for potential API
changes, data loss, service interruption, or data inconsistency. It is highly
encouraged to thoroughly test the experimental features in your environment.

<Callout>

To enable multiple experimental features in Memgraph, you need to use the
`--experimental-enabled` flag followed by the name of the feature. Here's how
you can enable the `text-search`
feature at the same time:

`--experimental-enabled=text-search`

If you already have a Memgraph instance with an experimental feature enabled,
and you want to add another one, you will need to restart Memgraph. Ensure that
all the necessary flags are enabled during the restart.

## Experimental features list

### Text Search
- **Description**: Enables finding nodes based on property values within
  Memgraph, supporting both literal and regex searches, and the concept of
  aggregation. It is not guaranteed to work correctly in use cases involving
  concurrent transactions and replication.
- **Status**: Experimental. Provides text search functionalities but is not
  guaranteed to work correctly in use cases involving concurrent transactions
  and replication. There are no short-term plans to improve text-search
  capabilities. If you are interested in improvements, please contact us on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/memgraph).
- **Usage**: Enable the feature using the flag
  `--experimental-enabled=text-search`.
- **Documentation**: For more details, visit the [Text Search
  documentation](/querying/text-search).
