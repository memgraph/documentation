# Experimental features

These features are actively being developed and may change or be removed in
future releases. Use them with caution in production environments and only if
you thoroughly understand their implications and are prepared for potential API
changes, data loss, service interruption, or data inconsistency. It is highly
encouraged to thoroughly test the experimental features in your environment.

<Callout>

To enable multiple experimental features in Memgraph, you need to use the
`--experimental-enabled` flag followed by the name of the feature. Here's how
you can enable the `high-availability`, `system-replication`, and `text-search`
features at the same time:

`--experimental-enabled=high-availability,system-replication,text-search`

If you already have a Memgraph instance with an experimental feature enabled,
and you want to add another one, you will need to restart Memgraph. Ensure that
all the necessary flags are enabled during the restart.

## Experimental features list

### High availability mode
- **Description**: This feature enables high availability capabilities in Memgraph Enterprise Edition.
- **Status**: Experimental. Designed to improve system reliability and uptime, but may still have stability issues.
- **Usage**: Enable the feature using the flag `--experimental-enabled=high-availability`.
- **Documentation**: For more details, visit the [High Availability Mode documentation](/database-management/configuration).

### System replication
- **Description**: This feature enables authentication and multi-tenancy replication in Memgraph Enterprise Edition.
- **Status**: Experimental. Enhances data replication capabilities with added security and multi-tenancy features.
- **Usage**: Enable the feature using the flag `--experimental-enabled=system-replication`.
- **Documentation**: For more details, visit the [Experimental Replication documentation](/clustering/replication/experimental-replication).

### Text search
- **Description**: This feature enables text search capabilities within Memgraph. Text search only supports some usage modalities and is not guaranteed to work correctly in use cases involving concurrent transactions and replication.
- **Status**: Experimental. Provides text search functionalities but is not guaranteed to work correctly in use cases that involve concurrent transactions and replication.
- **Usage**: Enable the feature using the flag `--experimental-enabled=text-search`.
- **Documentation**: For more details, visit the [Text Search documentation](/querying/text-search).
