# Experimental features

These features are actively being developed and may change or be removed in
future releases. Use them with caution in production environments and only if
you thoroughly understand their implications and are prepared for potential API
changes, data loss, service interruption, or data inconsistency. It is highly
encouraged to thoroughly test the experimental features in your environment.


## Enabling experimental features

To enable an experimental feature in Memgraph, set `--experimental-enabled` flag
to the appropriate value. For example, to run Memgraph in Docker container with the vector
search feature, run the following command:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph --experimental-enabled=vector-search
```

To enable more than one experimental feature, list them all, divided by a comma.
For example, to enable vector search and text search features, run Memgraph in
Docker container with the following command:

```
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph --experimental-enabled=vector-search,text-search
```

Some experimental features, such as `vector-search`, require
`--experimental-config` flag for proper configuration.

If you already have a Memgraph instance with an experimental feature enabled,
and you want to add another one, you will need to restart Memgraph. Ensure that
all the necessary flags are enabled during the restart.

Changing the configuration settings depends on the way you are using Memgraph,
so please refer to the [configuration
docs](/database-management/configuration#changing-configuration) for more
information.
