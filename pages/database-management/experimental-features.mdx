# Experimental features

These features are actively being developed and may change or be removed in
future releases. Use them with caution in production environments and only if
you thoroughly understand their implications and are prepared for potential API
changes, data loss, service interruption, or data inconsistency. It is highly
encouraged to thoroughly test the experimental features in your environment.

<Callout>

To enable multiple experimental features in Memgraph, you need to use the
`--experimental-enabled` flag followed by the name of the feature. Here's how
you can enable the `vector-search` and `text-search` features at the same time: 

`--experimental-enabled=vector-search,text-search`

If you already have a Memgraph instance with an experimental feature enabled,
and you want to add another one, you will need to restart Memgraph. Ensure that
all the necessary flags are enabled during the restart.

Some experimental features, such as `vector-search`, require
`--experimental-config` flag for proper configuration.

## Experimental features list

### Vector Search
- **Description**: Enables approximate nearest neighbor searches in Memgraph by
  leveraging the [HNSW](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320) algorithm to index
  node properties as vectors. This feature supports various similarity metrics,
  enabling efficient retrieval of nodes based on vector similarity. While the
  database itself can operate at any configured isolation level, the vector
  index specifically functions at the `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation level.
  **This means that changes to the index made by uncommitted transactions are
  immediately visible to other transactions, regardless of the database's
  isolation level!**
- **Status**: Experimental. The vector search feature is still under
  development and not fully integrated with other Memgraph functionalities.
  Unlike other index types, it currently lacks support for durability,
  replication, and multi-tenancy. Additionally, vector indexes must be created
  using the `--experimental-config` flag, rather than through Cypher queries
  like other indexes. Although durability, replication, and multi-tenancy are
  not yet supported, you can work around these limitations by ensuring that
  every database instance (main or replica) is started with the same
  `--experimental-config` flag. This ensures expected behavior for these
  features across instances. Vector search is an actively developed feature,
  and we are continuously working on improving its capabilities. At the time of
  writing, 2024-11-27, the plan is to make feature stable at the time of the
  next release which is 2025-01-29.
- **Usage**: Enable the feature using the flag
  `--experimental-enabled=vector-search`. Configure the feature using
  `--experimental-config`. For example:
  ```shell
  --experimental-config=
  '
  {
    "vector-search": {
      "index_name": {
        "label": "Node",
        "property": "vector",
        "dimension": 2,
        "capacity": 1000,
        "metric": "cos",
        "scalar": "f32",
        "resize_coefficient": 2,
      }
    }
  }
  '
  ```
  Keep in mind that both flags are required and the configuration requires the
  following mandatory fields: `label`, `property`, `dimension` and `capacity`.

  page](/querying/vector-search).

### Text Search
- **Description**: Enables finding nodes based on property values within
  Memgraph, supporting both literal and regex searches, and the concept of
  aggregation. It is not guaranteed to work correctly in use cases involving
  concurrent transactions and replication.
- **Status**: Early experimental. Provides text search functionalities but is not
  guaranteed to work correctly in use cases involving concurrent transactions
  and replication. There are no short-term plans to improve text-search
  capabilities. If you are interested in improvements, please contact us on
  [Discord](https://discord.gg/memgraph).
- **Usage**: Enable the feature using the flag
  `--experimental-enabled=text-search`.
- **Documentation**: For more details, visit the [Text Search
  documentation](/querying/text-search).
