# Monitoring

Monitoring applications and databases is essential to track the load, resources, logs, transactions, latency, etc. 

Memgraph currently supports:
1. **Log tracking via WebSocket server**: Log tracking is helpful for debugging purposes and monitoring the database operations. 
2. **Monitoring via HTTP server (Enterprise Edition)**: In the Enterprise edition, besides log tracking, Memgraph allows tracking information about transactions, query latencies, snapshot recovery latencies, triggers, bolt messages, indexes, and more, using an HTTP server.


## Log tracking via WebSocket server 

Connect to Memgraph's logging server via WebSocket to forward logs to all the
connected clients.


### Log messages

Each log that is written to the [log file](logs.mdx#logs) is forwarded to the
connected clients in the following format:

```json
{
  event: "log",
  level: "trace"|"debug"|"info"|"warning"|"error"|"critical",
  message: "<log-message>"
}
```


### Connection

To connect to Memgraph's WebSocket server, use the following URL:

```plaintext
ws://host:port
```

The default host is `0.0.0.0`, but it can be changed using the
`--monitoring-address=` configuration flag.  

The default port is `7444`, but it can be changed using the `--monitoring-port`
configuration flag.

To connect to Memgraph's WebSocket server using the default configuration and
Python client, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets

HOST = 'localhost'
PORT = '7444'

# The WebSocket URL
ws_url = f'ws://{HOST}:{PORT}'

async def read_logs():
    async with websockets.connect(ws_url) as websocket:
        print(f"Connected to Memgraph at {ws_url}")
        try:
            # Keep reading messages (logs) from the server
            while True:
 log_message = await websocket.recv()
                print(log_message)
        except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
            print("Connection to Memgraph closed.")

asyncio.run(read_logs())
```

The code structure is similar in other languages, depending on the WebSocket
library used.

If you want to connect with a WebSocket Secure (WSS) connection. Set the
following configuration flags to enable an SSL connection: `--bolt-cert-file`
and `--bolt-key-file`.

These flags are also used to set up an SSL connection when connecting via Bolt
protocol, hence the name. Refer to the configuration page to learn how to
[update the
configuration](/database-management/configuration#changing-configuration) and to
see the list of all available [configuration
flags](/database-management/configuration#list-of-configuration-flags).


### Authentication

If authentication is not used (there are no users present in Memgraph), no
authentication message is expected, and no response will be returned. 

If the authentication is used, Memgraph won't send a message to a certain
connection until it's authenticated.

To authenticate, create a JSON with the credentials in the following format:

```json
{
  "username": "<username>",
  "password": "<password>"
}
```

If the credentials are valid, the connection will be made, and the client will
receive the messages. As a response, the client should receive the following
message:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User has been successfully authenticated!"
}
```

If they are invalid or the first message is in an invalid format, the
connection is dropped. As a response, the following message is sent:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "<error-message>"
}
```

To use WebSocket to authenticate, send the JSON message to the WebSocket server:

```python
import asyncio
import json
import websockets

HOST = "localhost"
PORT = "7444"
USERNAME = "memgraph"
PASSWORD = "memgraph"

ws_url = f"ws://{HOST}:{PORT}"


async def authenticate_and_read_logs(websocket):
    # Send authentication credentials
 credentials = json.dumps({"username": USERNAME, "password": PASSWORD})
    await websocket.send(credentials)

    # Wait for authentication response
 response = await websocket.recv()
 response_data = json.loads(response)
    if response_data.get("success"):
        print("Authentication successful!")
    else:
        print(f"Authentication failed: {response_data.get('message')}")
        return  # Stop if authentication fails

    # After successful authentication, start reading logs
    try:
        while True:
 log_message = await websocket.recv()
            print(log_message)
    except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
        print("Connection to Memgraph closed.")


async def connect_and_authenticate():
    async with websockets.connect(ws_url) as websocket:
        print(f"Connected to Memgraph at {ws_url}")
        await authenticate_and_read_logs(websocket)


asyncio.run(connect_and_authenticate())
```



#### Authorization (Enterprise)

Permission for connecting through WebSocket is controlled by the [`WEBSOCKET`
privilege](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control#privileges).


## Monitoring via HTTP server (Enterprise)

In the Enterprise Edition, Memgraph allows tracking information about
transactions, query latencies, snapshot recovery latencies, triggers, Bolt
messages, indexes, streams, and many more metrics using an HTTP server.

To retrieve data from the HTTP server, [enter a valid Memgraph
Enterprise license key](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).  

The default address and port for the metrics server is `0.0.0.0:9091`, and can
be configured using the `--metrics-address` and `--metrics-port` [configuration
flags](/database-management/configuration#list-of-configuration-flags).

To retrieve the metrics, send a GET request to the following URL:

```plaintext
http://host:port
```

Here is an example of how to retrieve metrics using Python:

```python
import requests
import json


def fetch_memgraph_metrics():
 metrics_url = "http://0.0.0.0:9091/metrics"

    try:
 response = requests.get(metrics_url, timeout=5) 

        if response.status_code == 200:
            try:
 metrics_data = json.loads(response.text)
 pretty_metrics = json.dumps(metrics_data, indent=4)
                print("Memgraph Metrics:\n", pretty_metrics)
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                print("Memgraph Metrics:\n", response.text)
        else:
            print(f"Failed to fetch metrics. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


fetch_memgraph_metrics()
```

The example above will print the metric similar to the [example
response](#example-response) below.


### System metrics

All system metrics measuring different parts of the system can be divided into
three different types:
- **Gauge** - a single value of some variable in the system (e.g. memory usage)
- **Counter (uint64_t)** - a value that can be incremented or decremented (e.g.
 number of active transactions in the system)
- **Histogram (uint64_t)** - distribution of measured values (e.g. certain
 percentile of query latency on N measured queries)

#### General metrics

 | Name           | Type             | Description                                                 |
 | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

 | peak_memory_usage | Gauge (uint64_t) | Peak RAM memory usage in the system during the whole run (in bytes).  |

#### Index metrics

 | Name                       | Type    | Description                                            |

#### Operator metrics

Before a Cypher query is executed, it is converted into an internal form
suitable for execution, known as a query plan. A query plan is a tree-like data
structure describing a pipeline of operations that will be performed on the
database in order to yield the results for a given query. Every node within a
plan is known as [a logical operator](/querying/query-plan#query-plan-operators)
and describes a particular operation.

### Example response

If there aren't any modifying configurations, by sending a GET request to
`localhost:9091` in the local Memgraph build will result in a response similar
