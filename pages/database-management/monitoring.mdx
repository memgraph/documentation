# Monitoring

Monitoring applications and databases is essential to track the load and resources used by the system. 

Memgraph currently supports:
1. **Real-time logs tracking via WebSocket server**: Log tracking is helpful for debugging purposes and monitoring the database operations. 
2. **Metrics tracking via HTTP server (Enterprise Edition)**: In the Enterprise edition, besides log tracking, Memgraph allows tracking information about
transactions, query latencies, snapshot recovery latencies, triggers, Bolt
messages, indexes, streams, memory, operators and sesions, all by using an HTTP server.


## Real-time logs tracking via WebSocket server 

Connect to Memgraph's logging server via WebSocket to forward logs to all the
connected clients.


### Log messages

Each log that is written to the [log file](logs.mdx#logs) is forwarded to the
connected clients in the following format:

```json
{
  event: "log",
  level: "trace"|"debug"|"info"|"warning"|"error"|"critical",
  message: "<log-message>"
}
```


### Connection

To connect to Memgraph's WebSocket server, use the following URL:

```plaintext
ws://host:port
```

The default host is `0.0.0.0`, but it can be changed using the
`--monitoring-address=` configuration flag.  

The default port is `7444`, but it can be changed using the `--monitoring-port`
configuration flag.

To connect to Memgraph's WebSocket server using the default configuration and
Python client, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets

HOST = 'localhost'
PORT = '7444'

# The WebSocket URL
ws_url = f'ws://{HOST}:{PORT}'

async def read_logs():
    async with websockets.connect(ws_url) as websocket:
        print(f"Connected to Memgraph at {ws_url}")
        try:
            # Keep reading messages (logs) from the server
            while True:
 log_message = await websocket.recv()
                print(log_message)
        except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
            print("Connection to Memgraph closed.")

asyncio.run(read_logs())
```

The code structure is similar in other languages, depending on the WebSocket
library used.

If you want to connect with a WebSocket Secure (WSS) connection, set the
`--bolt-cert-file` and `--bolt-key-file` configuration flags to enable an SSL
connection.  Refer to the configuration page to learn how to [update the
configuration](/database-management/configuration#changing-configuration) and to
see the list of all available [configuration
flags](/database-management/configuration#list-of-configuration-flags).


### Authentication

When authentication is not used due to no users present in Memgraph, no
authentication message is expected, and no response will be returned. 

When the authentication is used, Memgraph won't send a message to a certain
connection until it's authenticated.

To authenticate, create a JSON with the credentials in the following format:

```json
{
  "username": "<username>",
  "password": "<password>"
}
```

If the credentials are valid, the connection will be made, and the client will
receive the messages. As a response, the client should receive the following
message:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User has been successfully authenticated!"
}
```

If they are invalid or the first message is in an invalid format, the
connection is dropped. As a response, the following message is sent:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "<error-message>"
}
```

To use WebSocket to authenticate, send the JSON message to the WebSocket server:

```python
import asyncio
import json
import websockets

HOST = "localhost"
PORT = "7444"
USERNAME = "memgraph"
PASSWORD = "memgraph"

ws_url = f"ws://{HOST}:{PORT}"


async def authenticate_and_read_logs(websocket):
    # Send authentication credentials
    credentials = json.dumps({"username": USERNAME, "password": PASSWORD})
    await websocket.send(credentials)

    # Wait for authentication response
    response = await websocket.recv()
    response_data = json.loads(response)
    if response_data.get("success"):
        print("Authentication successful!")
    else:
        print(f"Authentication failed: {response_data.get('message')}")
        return  # Stop if authentication fails

    # After successful authentication, start reading logs
    try:
        while True:
            log_message = await websocket.recv()
            print(log_message)
    except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
        print("Connection to Memgraph closed.")


async def connect_and_authenticate():
    async with websockets.connect(ws_url) as websocket:
        print(f"Connected to Memgraph at {ws_url}")
        await authenticate_and_read_logs(websocket)


asyncio.run(connect_and_authenticate())
```



#### Authorization (Enterprise)

Permission for connecting through WebSocket is controlled by the [`WEBSOCKET`
privilege](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control#privileges).


## Metrics tracking via HTTP server (Enterprise Edition)

In the Enterprise Edition, Memgraph allows tracking information about
transactions, query latencies, snapshot recovery latencies, triggers, Bolt
messages, indexes, streams, memory, operators and sesions, all by using using an HTTP server.

To retrieve data from the HTTP server, [enter a valid Memgraph
Enterprise license key](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).  

The default address and port for the metrics server is `0.0.0.0:9091`, and can
be configured using the `--metrics-address` and `--metrics-port` [configuration
flags](/database-management/configuration#list-of-configuration-flags).

To retrieve the metrics, send a GET request to the following URL:

```plaintext
http://host:port
```

Here is an example of how to retrieve metrics using Python:

```python
import requests
import json


def fetch_memgraph_metrics():
    metrics_url = "http://0.0.0.0:9091/metrics"

    try:
    response = requests.get(metrics_url, timeout=5) 

        if response.status_code == 200:
            try:
                metrics_data = json.loads(response.text)
                pretty_metrics = json.dumps(metrics_data, indent=4)
                print("Memgraph Metrics:\n", pretty_metrics)
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                print("Memgraph Metrics:\n", response.text)
        else:
            print(f"Failed to fetch metrics. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


fetch_memgraph_metrics()
```

The example above will print the metric similar to the [example
response](#example-response) below.


### System metrics

All system metrics measuring different parts of the system can be divided into
three different types:
- **Gauge** - a single value of some variable in the system (e.g. memory usage)
- **Counter (uint64_t)** - a value that can be incremented or decremented (e.g.
 number of active transactions in the system)
- **Histogram (uint64_t)** - distribution of measured values (e.g. certain
 percentile of query latency on N measured queries)

#### General metrics

 | Name           | Type             | Description                                                 |

#### Operator metrics

Before a Cypher query is executed, it is converted into an internal form
suitable for execution, known as a query plan. A query plan is a tree-like data
structure describing a pipeline of operations that will be performed on the
database in order to yield the results for a given query. Every node within a
plan is known as [a logical operator](/querying/query-plan#query-plan-operators)
and describes a particular operation.

## Prometheus exporter

Memgraph also supports exporting metrics in the
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) format. For more information on how to set
up the Prometheus exporter, refer to the [Prometheus
exporter](https://github.com/memgraph/prometheus-exporter) repository.

## Session trace

A session refers to a temporary, interactive connection from a client (either a user or an application) to the database
server. It used to execute a series of transactions and queries.  Session trace is a feature in Memgraph that allows you
to profile the execution of all queries within a session, providing detailed information on query planning and
execution. This can be invaluable for understanding performance bottlenecks and optimizing database interactions.

Before enabling session trace, you need to define a directory where the session logs will be stored. This is done using
the `--query-log-directory` [configuration flag](/database-management/configuration#query), which can be set either at
Memgraph startup via the command line, or during an active session.

To set the query log directory while launching from the command line using Docker, do the following:
```shell
docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --name memgraph memgraph/memgraph --query-log-directory {directory}
```

To set the query log directory interactively, use the following command:
```cypher
SET DATABASE SETTING "query-log-directory" TO "{directory}";
```

Replace `{directory}` with the desired path inside the Memgraph environment, either native or within a container.

If this directory is not set, you will receive the following error when attempting to enable session trace:

```
The flag --query-log-directory has to be present in order to enable session trace.
```

Once the query log directory is configured, you can enable session trace for your current session using the following command:

```cypher
SET SESSION TRACE ON;
```

This command initiates logging for the session, and the result will include the unique session UUID being tracked:

| session uuid                           |
| -------------------------------------- |
| "de9c907b-6675-40bd-bf09-d4ce7b24f22d" |

This UUID is used to identify the session log file.

#### Understanding the Session Trace Log

The session trace log captures detailed information for every query executed during the session, including:

- **Session UUID**: Unique identifier for the session.
- **Transaction ID**: ID of the current query transaction.
- **User Name**: The user executing the query.
- **Query Name and Explain Plan**: The name and execution plan of the query.
- **Query Planning and Execution Timings**: Start and end timestamps, as well as execution times for query planning and execution.
- **Commit Timings**: Start and end timestamps, and execution time for query commit.
- **Profile Plan and Metadata**: Detailed profiling information and metadata for the query.

This detailed logging helps in profiling the entire session workload, increasing visibility into potential
performance bottlenecks without congesting the system log.

#### Accessing the Log File

The session trace log is stored at `{--query-log-directory}/{session uuid}.log`, where `--query-log-directory` 
is the directory you defined earlier, and `session uuid` is the UUID obtained when session trace was enabled.

To stop logging additional information for the current session, use the following command:

```cypher
SET SESSION TRACE OFF;
```

After executing this command, no further data will be written to the session trace log for the active session.
