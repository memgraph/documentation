# Monitoring

In production systems, monitoring of applications is crucial, and that includes
databases as well. Memgraph allows monitoring the database via WebSocket server and a
HTTP server. 

## Monitoring via WebSocket server

Connect to Memgraph's monitoring server via WebSocket to forwarded logs to all
the connected clients.

### Connection

To connect to Memgraph's WebSocket server use the following URL:

```plaintext
ws://host:port
```

The default host is `localhost` but it can be changed using the
`--monitoring-host` configuration flag.  
The default port is `7444` but it can be changed using the `--monitoring-port`
configuration flag.

If you want to connect with a WebSocket Secure (WSS) connection. Set the
following configuration flags to enable
an SSL connection: `--bolt-cert-file` and `--bolt-key-file`.

These flags are also used to set up an SSL connection when connecting via Bolt
protocol, hence the name. Refer to the configuration page to learn how to
[update the
configuration](/database-management/configuration#changing-configuration)
and to see the list of all available [configuration
flags](/database-management/configuration#list-of-configuration-flags).

If both of the configuration flags are set, use the following URL to connect to
the WebSocket server:

```plaintext
wss://host:port
```

### Authentication

If authentication is not used (there are no users present in Memgraph),
no authentication message is expected, and no response will be returned. 

If the authentication is used, Memgraph won't send a message to a certain
connection until it's authenticated.

To authenticate, create a JSON with the credentials in the following format:

```json
{
  "username": "<username>",
  "password": "<password>"
}
```

If the credentials are valid, the connection will be made, and the client will
receive the messages. As a response, the client should receive the following
message:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User has been successfully authenticated!"
}
```

If they are invalid or the first message is in the invalid format, the
connection is dropped. As a response, the following message is sent:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "<error-message>"
}
```

#### Authorization (Enterprise)

Permission for connecting through WebSocket is controlled by the [`WEBSOCKET`
privilege](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control#privileges).

### Log messages

Each log that is written to the log file is forwarded to the connected clients
in the following format:

```json
{
  event: "log",
  level: "trace"|"debug"|"info"|"warning"|"error"|"critical",
  message: "<log-message>"
}
```

Read more about [logs](/database-management/logs) in Memgraph.

## Monitoring via HTTP server (Enterprise)

In the Enterprise Edition, Memgraph allows tracking information about
transactions, query latencies, snapshot recovery latencies, triggers, bolt
messages, indexes, streams, and many more using an HTTP server.

To start the metrics HTTP server, [enter a valid Memgraph Enterprise license
key](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise) and you will be able 
to retrieve data from the HTTP server. 

### Configure the HTTP endpoint

The default address and port for the metrics server is `0.0.0.0:9091`, and can
be configured using the `--metrics-address` and `--metrics-port` [configuration
flags](/database-management/configuration#list-of-configuration-flags).

### System metrics

All system metrics measuring different parts of the system can be divided into three different types:
- **Gauge** - a single value of some variable in the system (e.g. memory usage)
- **Counter (uint64_t)** - a value that can be incremented or decremented (e.g. number of active transactions in the system)
- **Histogram (uint64_t)** - distribution of measured values (e.g. certain percentile of query latency on N measured queries)

#### General metrics

 | Name           | Type             | Description                                                 |
 | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
 | vertex_count   | Gauge (uint64_t) | Number of nodes stored in the system.                       |
 | edge_count     | Gauge (uint64_t) | Number of relationships stored in the system.               |
 | average_degree | Gauge (double)   | Average number of relationships of a single node.           |
 | memory_usage   | Gauge (uint64_t) | Amount of RAM used reported by the OS (in bytes).           |
 | disk_usage     | Gauge (uint64_t) | Amount of disk space used by the [data directory](/fundamentals/data-durability) (in bytes). |

#### Index metrics

 | Name                       | Type    | Description                                            |
 | -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
 | ActiveLabelIndices         | Counter | Number of active label indexes in the system.          |
 | ActiveLabelPropertyIndices | Counter | Number of active label property indexes in the system. |

#### Operator metrics

Before a Cypher query is executed, it is converted into an internal form suitable for execution, known as a query plan.
A query plan is a tree-like data structure describing a pipeline of operations that will be performed on the database in order to
yield the results for a given query. Every node within a plan is known as
[a logical operator](/querying/query-plan#query-plan-operators) and describes a particular operation.

### Example response

If there aren't any modifying configurations, by sending a GET request to `localhost:9091` in the 
local Memgraph build will result in a response similar to the one below.
