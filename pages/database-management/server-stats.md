# Server stats

Memgraph supports multiple queries to get information about the instance that is
being queried.

## Instance version

To get the version of the instance being queried, run the following query:

```cypher
SHOW VERSION;
```

## Storage information

Running the following query will return certain information about the storage of
the current instance:

```cypher
SHOW STORAGE INFO;
```

The result will contain the following fields:
