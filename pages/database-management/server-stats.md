# Server stats

Memgraph supports multiple queries to get information about the instance that is
being queried.

## Instance version

To get the version of the instance being queried, run the following query:

```cypher
SHOW VERSION;
```

## Storage information

Running the following query will return certain information about the storage of
the current instance:

```cypher
SHOW STORAGE INFO;
```

The result will contain the following fields:

| Field                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Metrics information

Running this query will show the system metrics. Same metrics can be provided from the HTTP endpoint at default
port 9091. This is a query that only works with the Memgraph Enterprise License. For the information about the metrics,
please see the [information about monitoring via HTTP server](/database-management/monitoring#monitoring-via-http-server-enterprise).
