If you're interested in the Memgraph Enterprise Trial, you need to fill out the
following [form](https://memgraph.com/enterprise-trial) where one of the fields
is the organization name.

Whether you bought Memgraph Enterprise or requested a trial, you will receive a
file with the values you need to set the `organization.name` and the
`enterprise.license` configuration values to.

If you want to enable the Enterprise Edition on startup, [set the configuration
flags](/configuration/configuration-settings#changing-configuration)  or
[environment
variables](/database-management/configuration#environment-variables) to the
correct values.

If you are already running Memgraph Community Edition, these configuration flags
can also be adjusted [during
runtime](/configuration/configuration-settings#during-runtime), or you can run
the following queries to set the values:

```
SET DATABASE SETTING 'organization.name' TO 'Organization';
SET DATABASE SETTING 'enterprise.license' TO 'License';
```

To check the set values run:

```opencypher
SHOW DATABASE SETTING 'organization.name';
SHOW DATABASE SETTING 'enterprise.license';
```

or:

```opencypher
SHOW DATABASE SETTINGS;
```

To get all the information about the Memgraph Enterprise License that was
injected into the system, run:

```cypher
SHOW LICENSE INFO;
```

## Upgrading or downgrading the license

Memgraph licenses are issued based on the maximum unique data stored. So, if you
get a 1TB license, you can store 1TB of data. When you reach that capacity you
will no longer be able to run `write` queries, only `read` and `delete` queries.
That means it is possible to analyze the existing data but new data can no
longer be added until you upgrade or free storage by deleting some of the data.

Upon upgrading the license by entering a new license key the `write` queries
will be enabled.

To check the used storage, run `SHOW STORAGE INFO;`.

## License key expiry

Once the license key expires, the enterprise features will be disabled, but the
data stored in the database will remain intact. You will still be able to add
more data, but any enterprise features that require specific actions will no
longer function. For example, you will not be able to create any new databases.

## Security features

### Role-based access control

Most databases used in production have multiple users accessing and modifying
data within the database, which might pose a serious security concern for system
administrators wishing to grant only certain privileges to specific users. With
[role-based access
controls](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control#user-roles-enterprise-feature),
a set of users can have different [privilege
levels](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control#privileges-enterprise-feature).
For even more control, Memgraph has added [label-based access control
(LBAC)](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control#label-based-access-control)
as a more fine-grained access control to enable authorization on node labels and
relationship edge types. By applying authorization to graph’s first class
citizens, a database administrator can now keep all the data in one database
while keeping any private data secure from those who don’t have adequate
permission.

### Authentication system integrations

Memgraph supports authentication and authorization using external auth modules.
It includes built-in support for basic (username and password) authentication
via
[LDAP](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/auth-system-integrations#ldap),
as well as [single sign-on over the SAML and OIDC
protocols](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/auth-system-integrations#single-sign-on).

### Impersonate user
The [impersonate
user](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/impersonate-user)
feature lets authorized users run queries on behalf of another user. When using
impersonation, the permitted user adopts the full permissions and context of the
impersonated user. This means they can execute queries and perform actions
exactly as the impersonated user, with all associated privileges. This feature
provides a powerful tool for managing user permissions, debugging, and
performing administrative tasks. By leveraging the ability to impersonate other
users, you can ensure more efficient management of users and roles while
maintaining robust security and access control within your graph database.

### Hiding sensitive information

To enhance security, it’s crucial to ensure that sensitive information is not
logged. With Memgraph Enterprise, users can [mask
passwords](/database-management/logs#hiding-passwords-enterprise) - all
passwords are replaced with **** to prevent their exposure in the logs. This
approach ensures that even if logs are accessed by unauthorized individuals,
they won’t be able to retrieve the actual passwords.

## Logging and monitoring 

### Audit log

Memgraph supports all query [audit
logging](/database-management/logs#audit-log-enterprise). When enabled, the
audit log contains **records of all queries executed on the database**. Each
executed query is one entry (one line) in the audit log. The audit log itself is
a CSV file. By default, the log is rotated every day and a full year of entries
is preserved.

### Metrics tracking via HTTP server

In production systems, monitoring of applications is crucial, and that includes
databases as well. Memgraph allows [tracking information about
transactions](/database-management/monitoring#metrics-tracking-via-http-server-enterprise-edition),
query latencies, snapshot recovery latencies, triggers, bolt messages, indexes,
streams, and many more using an HTTP server. That means you can [integrate
Memgraph with
Prometheus](https://memgraph.com/blog/use-prometheus-monitoring-memgraph-performance-metrics),
a time-series database that enables other databases and applications to monitor
and react to performance changes in the system just in time.

## Database management 

### High availability

[High availability](/clustering/high-availability) is a critical component for
maintaining a resilient database system. Especially for enterprises that require
uninterrupted data access and reliability. Memgraph’s Enterprise edition is the
ideal solution for those who need a worry-free, highly available system with
[automatic failover](/clustering/high-availability#failover). Built-in automatic
failover ensures your system remains operational with minimal downtime and
manual intervention.

### Multi-tenancy

[Multi-tenant support](/database-management/multi-tenancy) enables you to manage
multiple isolated databases within a single instance. That is especially useful
if you prefer having multiple clients in one database. Those isolated databases
within Memgraph function as distinct single-database Memgraph instances. That
means that queries executed on a specific database should operate as if it were
the sole database in the system, preventing cross-database contamination.

### CRON snapshot scheduling

Memgraph supports [periodic snapshot
creation](/fundamentals/data-durability#periodic-snapshots) in defined
intervals. With Memgraph Enterprise, users can define these intervals as
[CRON](https://crontab.guru/) expressions.

## Querying 

### Dynamic graph algorithms

[Dynamic graph
algorithms](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms#dynamic-graph-algorithms-enterprise)
allow you to perform **real-time, scalable computations on changing data**.
These algorithms have been specifically developed to handle high-speed updates
and large-scale graph changes without needing to restart the computation
process.

Here’s a breakdown to help you compare the Community and Enterprise offering in
terms of graph algorithms:

| Feature        | Static algorithms (Community)                          | Dynamic algorithms (Enterprise)                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance** | High-performing at scale                               | Real-time performance at scale                    |
| **Handling graph updates** | Requires recomputation                          | Updates in real-time without recomputation        |
| **Use case**   | Great for batch or periodic processing                  | Ideal for real-time applications                  |
| **Licensing**  | Free (Community version)                                | Part of Enterprise version                        |


### Time to live (TTL)

[Time-to-live](/querying/time-to-live) allows a user to tag vertices with an
expiration time. Once a vertex has expired, the vertex and all associated edges
will be deleted.

### User profiles
[User profiles](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/user-profiles) allows administrators to monitor and limit 
resources used by specific users. You can set limits on the number of concurrent sessions and transaction memory usage to control resource consumption and prevent system abuse.

## Memgraph Lab Enterprise features 

### Monitoring

[Monitoring](/memgraph-lab/features/monitoring) feature tracks resource usage,
database size, query activity, transaction flow and active sessions, providing
real-time insights into database performance.

### Sharing features

[Query sharing](/memgraph-lab/features/sharing-features#query-sharing) allows
users to share selected queries from the query execution or previously run
queries from the history. [Graph Style Script (GSS)
sharing](/memgraph-lab/features/sharing-features#graph-style-script-sharing)
allows users to share styling scripts among team members.

### Single sign-on

[Single sign-on (SSO)](/memgraph-lab/features/single-sign-on) provides
authorization and authentification to your database. It supports two types of
SSO methods - OpenID Connect (OIDC + OAuth 2.0) and SAML- and two identity
providers - Microsoft Azure (Entra ID) and Okta.
