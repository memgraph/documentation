# How multi-tenancy works
Multi-tenant support in Memgraph enables users to manage multiple isolated
databases within a single instance. The primary objective is to facilitate
efficient resource isolation, maintain data integrity, and manage access for
different clients.

Memgraph for tenant uses the term `database`. Tenant here is a synonym, and multi-tenancy
refers to having multiple databases inside one Memgraph instance. The instance is what in
relational databases would refer to RDBMS (the Memgraph process, graph management system, which
manages all the databases).

## Databases specification

### Default database

A default database named `memgraph` is automatically created during startup. This database
is also the default database for those who don't use multi-tenancy, or use Memgraph Community
Edition.

New users are granted access only to this default database (they can connect to this database).
The default database name cannot be altered.

### Isolated databases

Isolated databases within Memgraph function as distinct single-database Memgraph
instances. Queries executed on a specific database should operate as if it were
the sole database in the system, preventing cross-database contamination. Users
interact with individual databases, and cross-database queries are prohibited.

Cross-database queries are not yet implemented. If you require this feature in Memgraph,
please open a Github issue, or contact our sales team!

Every database has its own database UUID, which can be read by running the `SHOW
STORAGE INFO` query on a particular database.

## Database configuration and data directory

At present, all isolated databases share identical configurations. There is no
provision to specify a per-database configuration.

The sole distinction lies in the location of the data directory. The designated
data directory serves as the root and retains data associated with the default
database. Other databases are housed in new directories within
`data_directory/databases/*db_name*`.

The default `memgraph` database also includes a directory
`data_directory/databases/memgraph`, which contains symbolic links leading back
to the root. Some links are proactively generated and their status may vary
based on configuration.

## Backwards compatibility

The multi-tenant feature ensures backwards compatibility, facilitating smooth
version upgrades and downgrades without disrupting user experience. During an
upgrade, previous data is migrated to the default database, while downgrading
retains data solely in the default database.

## Sharing of resources between tenants

In the current version, all isolated databases share the underlying resources so
there is no provision to restrict CPU or RAM usage for a specific database.
Instead, global limitations are imposed on Memgraph as a whole.
