# Multi-tenancy FAQ

## Capabilities

### Is there any limit to how many tenants Memgraph can have?
No, there are no limits to the number of tenants you can create in Memgraph, except for the aggregated size of
the whole graph since Memgraph is in-memory. The total memory available to your Memgraph instance will determine
the combined size of all tenant databases.

### Is there any way for a query to access another tenant?
No, this is the benefit of multi-tenancy which completely logically isolates the tenants. In the implementation,
those are completely different systems with their own respective graphs. Cross-database queries are prohibited,
ensuring complete data isolation between tenants.

### Is audit log integrated with multi-tenancy?
Audit logs encompass the active database name, positioned immediately after
the username field.

### How are system resources shared across tenants?
Currently, multi-tenancy doesn't have any strict requirements for tenants. It is important to monitor
your data growth closely across tenants in order to take necessary actions if a tenant becomes too big.
If you have a specific on-demand feature, let us know by contacting our sales team.

## Troubleshooting

### How can I troubleshoot if I misconfigured something with multi-tenancy?
We suggest you always troubleshoot multi-tenancy using the admin user which has all the privileges.
This way you're able to show the relevant information:
- `SHOW DATABASE PRIVILEGES FOR user` - see which databases user has access to
- `SHOW ROLES FOR user` - see which roles are enforced on the user
- `SHOW PRIVILEGES FOR user ON DATABASE x`- see which privileges the user has on the database
