# Multi-tenancy FAQ

## General questions

### Is there any limit to how many tenants Memgraph can have?
No, there are no limits to the number of tenants you can create in Memgraph, except for the aggregated size of
the whole graph since Memgraph is in-memory. The total memory available to your Memgraph instance will determine
the combined size of all tenant databases.

### Is there any way for a query to access another tenant?
No, this is the benefit of multi-tenancy which completely logically isolates the tenants. In the implementation,
those are completely different systems with their own respective graphs. Cross-database queries are prohibited,
ensuring complete data isolation between tenants.

### Is audit log integrated with multi-tenancy?
Audit logs encompass the active database name, positioned immediately after
the username field.
