# Configuration

Memgraph has a set of configuration options that can be fine-tuned for specific needs. 

The main Memgraph configuration file is available at the
`/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`. The file contains a set of default configuration values 
and key-value pairs that can be modified to suit your specific needs.

Each configuration setting is in the form: `--setting-name=value`.

You can check the current configuration by using the following query:

```opencypher
SHOW CONFIG;
```

## Changing configuration

The `memgraph.conf` file is the persistency for configuration. Changing the
configuration settings depends on the way you are using Memgraph and the
configuration settings you want to change.

Most of the configuration changes need to happen before Memgraph is
started. Still, a set of configuration settings can be [changed during
runtime](/configuration/configuration-settings#change-configuration-settings-during-runtime). 

Changing the configuration settings for Memgraph differs if you are using
Memgraph with **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, or if it was installed on the
native **Linux**.

       {<h3>Pass the configuration flags</h3>}

        The most simple way to change the configuration with Docker is by passing 
        the configuration options within the `docker run` command.
        For example, if you want to limit memory usage for the whole instance to 
        50 MiB and set the log level to `TRACE`, pass the configuration argument 
        like this.

        ```
        docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph --memory-limit=50 --log-level=TRACE
        ```

        {<h3>Update the configuration file</h3>}
        Another way of updating the default configuration is by updating the 
        configuration file on the running instance, but such action requires 
        restart so the update is applied. Here are the steps to change the 
        default configuration file:

        <Steps>

            {<h3>Start Memgraph</h3>}

            Start Memgraph with a `docker run` command.

            {<h3>Find container ID</h3>}

            Open a new terminal and find the `CONTAINER ID` of the Memgraph Docker container
            using the following command:

            ```console
            docker ps
            ```

            {<h3>Enter the container</h3>}

            Enter the Docker container with the following command:

            ```plaintext
            docker exec -it -u 0 <CONTAINER ID> bash
            ```

            {<h3>Install the text editor of your choice</h3>}

            For example, if you want to use `vim` run:

            ```console
            apt-get update && apt-get install -y vim
            ```

            {<h3>Edit the configuration file</h3>}

            The file is located at `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`.

            {<h3>Restart the instance</h3>}

            Run the following command:

            ```
            docker restart <CONTAINER ID>
            ```

        </Steps>

        {<h3>Provide additional configuration file</h3>}
        To achieve a different configuration on startup, you can also provide the 
        path to the additional configuration file which will override the default
        one. The file should contain the configuration settings in the form
        `--setting-name=value`. Still, if any configuration settings are set as 
        arguments, they will override the settings in the additional configuration 
        file as well. Providing the path to the additional configuration file 
        requires more steps than setting the configuration via arguments. That's 
        because the file you're pointing to must be located within the container 
        before the container is running. To provide the additional configuration 
        file, follow these steps:

        <Steps>
            {<h3>Create a container</h3>}
            Create a Docker container with the `--flag-file` argument pointing to the location where you'll save the additional configuration file.
            The file must be saved within the container, ideally in the `/etc/memgraph` folder, where the default configuration file is stored.
            ```
            docker create --name memgraph_container -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph --flag-file=/etc/memgraph/my.conf 
            ```

            Besides the `--flag-file` flag, you can [set the environment variable](#environment-variables) `MEMGRAPH_CONFIG` to achieve the same.

            {<h3>Copy the additional configuration file</h3>}
            ```
            docker cp my.conf memgraph_container:/etc/memgraph/my.conf
            ```

            {<h3>Start the container</h3>}

            ```
            docker start memgraph_container
            ```
        </Steps>
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
        {<h3>Pass the configuration flags</h3>}

        The most simple way to change the configuration with Docker Compose is 
        by passing the configuration options within the `command` line in the 
        `docker-compose.yml` file.

        For example, if you want to limit memory usage for the whole instance to 
        50 MiB and set the log level to `TRACE`, pass the configuration argument 
        like this.

        ```yaml
        services:
          memgraph:
            image: "memgraph/memgraph"
            ports:
              - "7687:7687"
              - "7444:7444"
            volumes:
              - mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph
              - mg_log:/var/log/memgraph
              - mg_etc:/etc/memgraph
            command: ["--log-level=TRACE", "--memory-limit=50"]
        volumes:
          mg_lib:
          mg_log:
          mg_etc:
        ```

        {<h3>Update the configuration file</h3>}

        Another way of updating the default configuration is by updating the 
        configuration file on the running instance, but such action requires 
        restart so the update is applied. Here are the steps to change the 
        default configuration file:

        <Steps>
          {<h3>Start Memgraph</h3>}

          Start Memgraph with a `docker-compose up` command.

          {<h3>Find container ID</h3>}

          Open a new terminal and find the `CONTAINER ID` of the Memgraph Docker 
          container using the following command:

          ```console
          docker ps
          ```

          {<h3>Enter the container</h3>}

          Enter the Docker container with the following command:

          ```plaintext
          docker exec -it -u 0 <CONTAINER ID> bash
          ```

          {<h3>Install the text editor of your choice</h3>}

          For example, if you want to use `vim` run:

          ```console
          apt-get update && apt-get install -y vim
          ```

          {<h3>Edit the configuration file</h3>}

          The file is located at `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`.

          {<h3>Restart the instance</h3>}

          Once you've added the environment variables, restart the instance using 
          Docker Compose. Place yourself in the terminal in the folder containing 
          the docker-compose.yml file and run the following command:
          ```
          docker-compose restart 
          ```

          This will restart the containers with the updated environment variables. 
        </Steps>

        {<h3>Provide additional configuration file</h3>}

        To achieve a different configuration on startup, you can also provide the 
        path to the additional configuration file which will override the default
        one. The file should contain the configuration settings in the form
        `--setting-name=value`. Still, if any configuration settings are set as

        file as well. Providing the path to the additional configuration file 
        requires more steps than setting the configuration via arguments. That's 
        because the file you're pointing to must be located within the container 
        before the container is running. To provide the additional configuration 
        file, follow these steps:

        <Steps>
            {<h3>Create a container</h3>}
            In your Docker Compose file, Add the `--flag-file` argument pointing 
            to the location where you'll save the additional configuration file.
            The file must be saved within the container, ideally in the 
            `/etc/memgraph` folder, where the default configuration file is stored.
            ```
            docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml create
            ```

            Besides the `--flag-file` flag, you can 
            [set the environment variable](#environment-variables) 
            `MEMGRAPH_CONFIG` to achieve the same.

            {<h3>Find container ID</h3>}

            Open a new terminal and find the `CONTAINER_ID` of the Memgraph Docker 
            container using the following command:

            ```console
            docker ps -a
            ```
            
            {<h3>Copy the additional configuration file</h3>}
            ```
            docker cp my.conf <CONTAINER_ID>:/etc/memgraph/my.conf
            ```

            {<h3>Start the container</h3>}

            ```
            docker-compose up
            ```
        </Steps>
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
          {<h3>Update the configuration file</h3>}
        Once Memgraph is installed on your Linux machine, check the status with: 
``` bash
systemctl status memgraph
```
        
        If the instance is in a running state, stop the Memgraph instance by running the following command:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl stop memgraph
        ```
       The configuration file is available at `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`. Open the configuration file with your favorite text editor.
        Modify it, save the changes, and start the instance by running the following command:

        ```bash
        sudo systemctl start memgraph
        ```

        {<h3>Provide additional configuration file</h3>}
        To achieve a different configuration on startup, you can also provide the path
        to the additional configuration file which will override the default
        one. The file should contain the configuration settings in the form
        `--setting-name=value`. 
        To provide the path to the additional configuration file, [set the environment variable](#environment-variables) `MEMGRAPH_CONFIG` to the correct path.

### Change configuration during runtime

Memgraph contains settings that can be modified during runtime using a Cypher query.
Some runtime settings are persisted between multiple runs, while others will
fallback to the value of the command-line argument.

| Setting name               | Description                                                                                   | Persistent between runs |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| organization.name          | Name of the organization using the instance of Memgraph (used for verifying the license key). | yes                     |
| enterprise.license         | License key for Memgraph Enterprise.                                                          | yes                     |
| server.name                | Bolt server name.                                                                             | yes                     |
| query.timeout              | Maximum allowed query execution time. Value of 0 means no limit.                              | yes                     |
| log.level                  | Minimum log level. Allowed values: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.              | no                      |
| log.to_stderr              | Log messages go to `stderr` in addition to `logfiles`.                                        | no                      |
| cartesian-product-enabled  | Enforces cartesian product operator during query matching.                                    | no                      |

All settings can be fetched by calling the following query:

```opencypher
SHOW DATABASE SETTINGS;
```

To check the value of a single setting, you can use a slightly different query:

```opencypher
SHOW DATABASE SETTING "setting.name";
```

If you want to change a value for a specific setting, following query should be used:

```opencypher
SET DATABASE SETTING "setting.name" TO "some-value";
```

### Multitenancy and configuration 

If you are using a multi-tenant architecture, all isolated databases share
identical configurations. At the moment, there is no way to specify a
per-database configuration.

### Environment variables

This section contains the list of environment variables that can be used to configure Memgraph.

Before the running of Memgraph, you can set the following environment variables:


| Variable          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Type       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| MEMGRAPH_USER     | Specifies the username for connecting to Memgraph. If the user does not exist, a new one is created with this username. Manual entry of credentials is always necessary when accessing Memgraph using Memgraph Lab. | `[string]` |
| MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD | Specifies the password for the user. If creating a new user, this password is assigned. For existing users, this setting does not change the password. Manual entry of credentials is always necessary when accessing Memgraph using Memgraph Lab. | `[string]` |
| MEMGRAPH_PASSFILE | Path to file that contains username and password for creating a user. Data in file should be in format `username:password` if your username or password contains  `:` just add `\` before for example `us\:ername:password` | `[string]`
| MEMGRAPH_CONFIG   | Path to the additional configuration file.                                                                                                                                                                                           | `[string]` |

In order to apply the environment variables with Memgraph, you can follow the steps below:

<Tabs items={["Docker", "Docker Compose" , "Linux"]}>

    <Tab>
    To set the environment variable when running Memgraph with Docker, use the following syntax:

    ```
    docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -e MEMGRAPH_USER=newUser -e MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD=pass memgraph/memgraph 
    ```

    The above command will start Memgraph in Docker container and create a user with username `newUser` and password `pass`. 
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
    In order to apply the environment variables in when running it with Docker Compose, add environment variables in your docker-compose.yml file:
    ```yaml
        services:
          memgraph:
            image: "memgraph/memgraph"
            ports:
              - "7687:7687"
              - "7444:7444"
            volumes:
              - mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph
              - mg_log:/var/log/memgraph
              - mg_etc:/etc/memgraph
            command: ["--log-level=TRACE"]
            enviroment:
              - MEMGRAPH_USER=memgraph
              - MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD=memgraph
        volumes:
          mg_lib:
          mg_log:
          mg_etc:
        ```
        ---

        Once you've added the environment variables, restart the instance using 
        Docker Compose. First, bring the services down. Place yourself in the 
        terminal in the folder containing the docker-compose.yml file and run 
        the following command:
        ```
        docker-compose down
        ```
        
        Then bring them back up:
        ```
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

        This will restart the containers with the updated environment variables. 

    </Tab>

    <Tab>

    In order to apply the environment variables in Memgraph, 
    open a service file in your favorite text editor and add the following lines:

    ```bash
        [Service]
        Environment="MEMGRAPH_USER=memgraph"
        Environment="MEMGRAPH_PASSWORD=memgraph"
    ```

    The service file should be located at `/lib/systemd/system/memgraph.service`.

    After you have added the environment variables, reload the systemd:

    ```bash
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

    After that you can restart or start the Memgraph instance:

    ```bash 
    systemctl start memgraph
    ```
    The enviroment variables will be applied to the Memgraph instance, and user will be created.

## Use `init` flags with Docker

With `init-file` and `init-data-file` configuration
flags, you can execute queries from a
CYPHERL file that need to be executed before or immediately after the Bolt
server starts. The CYPHERL file the `init-file` flag points to is usually used
to create users and set their passwords allowing only authorized users to access
the data in the first run. The CYPHERL file the `init-data-file` points to is
usually used to populate the database.

If you will run Memgraph with Docker, make sure that the `init-file` and
`init-data-file` configuration flags are referring to the files inside the
container before Memgraph starts. Files can't be directly copied into a
container before it's started because the filesystem of the container doesn't
exist until it's actually running. However, you can tackle this by using a
Dockerfile.

In this guide you will learn how to:
- [**Use the `init-file` flag with Docker**](#use-the-init-file-flag-with-docker)
- [**Use the `init-data-file` flag with Docker**](#use-the-init-data-file-flag-with-docker)

<Callout>

If an exception occurs during the execution of init script the queries will continue with execution.

### Use the `init-file` flag with Docker

<Steps>

{<h3> Create all necessary files </h3>}

First, create a local directory called `my_init_test` with `auth.cypherl` and
Dockerfile inside it.

Below is the content of the `auth.cypherl` file:

```
CREATE USER memgraph1 IDENTIFIED BY '1234';
```

The Dockerfile should be defined like this:

```bash
FROM memgraph/memgraph:latest

USER root

COPY auth.cypherl /usr/lib/memgraph/auth.cypherl

USER memgraph
```

The above Dockerfile builds an image based on `memgraph/memgraph:latest` image.
For other images, [check Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph). Then, it switches to the user `root` to
be able to copy the local file to the container where Memgraph will be run. Due
to the permissions set, it is recommended to copy it to `/usr/lib/memgraph/` or
any subfolder within that folder. In the end, the user is switched back to
`memgraph`.

{<h3> Build the Docker image </h3>}

Open the terminal, place yourself in the `my_init_test` directory and build the
image called `my_image` with the following command:

```
docker build -t my_image .
```

{<h3> Run the Docker image </h3>}

Once you've built the Docker image, you can run it with the `init-file` flag set
to the appropriate value:

```
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 my_image --init-file=/usr/lib/memgraph/auth.cypherl
```

To check all available flags in Memgraph, refer to [the configuration reference
guide](/database-management/configuration).

{<h3> Connect to Memgraph </h3>}

To verify that everything is set up correctly, [run Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization) and connect to
Memgraph. You'll notice that you have
to connect manually and input the correct username and password. This happened
because `auth.cypherl` file was run before the Bolt server started. You can also
run the `SHOW CONFIG` query:

![](/pages/database-management/configuration/memgraph-lab-init-file.png)

Notice how the current value of `init_file` is updated with the path to the
CYPHERL file inside the container.

</Steps>

### Use the `init-data-file` flag with Docker

<Steps>

{<h3> Create all necessary files </h3>}

First, create a local directory called `my_init_test` with `data.cypherl` and
Dockerfile inside it.

Below is the content of the `data.cypherl` file:

```

These Cypher queries will create the *Identity and access management* dataset
available in Memgraph Lab. You can get this CYPHERL file by exporting the
dataset from the Memgraph Lab.

The Dockerfile should be defined like this:

```bash
FROM memgraph/memgraph:latest

USER root

COPY data.cypherl /usr/lib/memgraph/data.cypherl

USER memgraph
```

The above Dockerfile builds an image based on `memgraph/memgraph:latest` image.
For other images, [check Memgraph's Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/memgraph). Then, it switches to the user `root` to
be able to copy the local file to the container where Memgraph will be run. Due
to the permissions set, it is recommended to copy it to `/usr/lib/memgraph/` or
any subfolder within that folder. In the end, the user is switched back to
`memgraph`.


{<h3> Build the Docker image </h3>}

image called `my_image` with the following command:

```
docker build -t my_image .
```

{<h3> Run the Docker image </h3>}

flag set to the appropriate value:

```
docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 my_image --init-data-file=/usr/lib/memgraph/data.cypherl
```

{<h3> Connect to Memgraph </h3>}

To verify that everything is set up correctly, [run Memgraph
Lab](/data-visualization), connect to Memgraph, and run the `SHOW CONFIG` query:

![](/pages/database-management/configuration/memgraph-lab-init-data-file.png)

Notice how the database is already populated and the current value of
`init_data_file` is updated with the path to the CYPHERL file inside the
container.
