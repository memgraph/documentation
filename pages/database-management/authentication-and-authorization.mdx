#  Authentication and authorization

Learn how authentication and authorization works in Memgraph. Manage users and
roles, secure the database with role-based and fine-grained access control and
learn how to integrate with other authentication systems.

## Recent changes to authentication requirements

Recent updates to Memgraph have introduced new requirements for authentication and authorization operations, particularly affecting multi-tenant environments:

### AUTH privilege requirement

Authentication and authorization queries (such as `CREATE USER`, `CREATE ROLE`, `GRANT`, `DENY`, `REVOKE`, etc.) now require the `AUTH` privilege. Users must be explicitly granted this privilege to perform user and role management operations.

### Default database access requirement

In addition to the `AUTH` privilege, users must also have access to the default "memgraph" database to execute authentication and authorization queries. This requirement applies even when the user is working in other databases within a multi-tenant environment.

### Multi-tenant recommendations

For multi-tenant environments, we recommend:
- Treating the default "memgraph" database as an administrative/system database
- Restricting access to the "memgraph" database to privileged users only
- Storing application data in tenant-specific databases
- Ensuring users who need to perform authentication operations have appropriate access

For detailed information about these requirements and best practices, see the [Role-based access control](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control#authentication-and-authorization-requirements) and [Multi-tenancy](/database-management/multi-tenancy#default-database-best-practices) documentation.
