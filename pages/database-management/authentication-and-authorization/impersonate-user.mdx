# Impersonate user (Enterprise)

## Overview

The **impersonate user** feature lets authorized users run queries on behalf of
another user. When using impersonation, the permitted user adopts the full
permissions and context of the impersonated user. This means they can execute
queries and perform actions exactly as the impersonated user, with all
associated privileges.

The impersonate user feature in Memgraph provides a powerful tool for
managing user permissions, debugging, and performing administrative tasks. By
leveraging the ability to impersonate other users, you can ensure more efficient
management of users and roles while maintaining robust security and access
control within your graph database.

**Enterprise**: Impersonate user feature requires a Memgraph Enterprise license to
function. For more information on Memgraph Enterprise and instructions
on how to enable it, refer to the
[enabling Memgraph Enterprise documentation](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).

### Targeting impersonation

The impersonated user is defined at the session start, as shown in the example
using the Neo4j Python driver:

```python
with driver.session(impersonated_user="user1") as session:
    # queries here will be executed as if user1 executed them
```

During this session, all queries will be executed with the privileges and
context of the impersonated user (`user1` in this case), effectively "switching"
the identity for the duration of the session.

## Permissions for impersonation

Only certain users or roles have the ability to impersonate other users. These permissions are managed with three key queries:

1. **GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER**
   This query allows a user or role to impersonate specific users or all users. The syntax and behavior are as follows:
   - **GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER [*] [list of users] TO user/role;**
     - `*`: Grants permission to impersonate all users.
     - `list of users`: Grants permission to impersonate specific users (comma-separated list).
     - `user/role`: The user or role receiving the impersonation permission.

   Example:
   Granting the `admin` role permission to impersonate `user1` and `user2`:
   ```cypher
   GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER user1,user2 TO admin;
   ```

   Example:
   Granting the `admin_user` user permission to impersonate all users:
   ```cypher
   GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER * TO admin_user;
   ```

2. **DENY IMPERSONATE_USER**
   This query denies impersonation rights to specific users or roles, allowing you to restrict who can impersonate whom.
   - **DENY IMPERSONATE_USER list of users TO user/role;**
     - `list of users`: Deny impersonation for specific users (comma-separated list).
     - `user/role`: The user or role being restricted from impersonating others.

   Example:
   Denying the `admin` role the ability to impersonate `user1` and `user2`:
   ```cypher
   DENY IMPERSONATE_USER user1,user2 TO admin;
   ```

3. **REVOKE IMPERSONATE_USER**
   This query removes the impersonation rights for a given user or role. It revokes all impersonation permissions for the specified user/role.
   - **REVOKE IMPERSONATE_USER FROM user/role;**
     - `user/role`: The user or role whose impersonation permissions are being revoked.

   Example:
   Revoking all impersonation permissions for the `admin` role:
   ```cypher
   REVOKE IMPERSONATE_USER FROM admin;
   ```

## Key points

- **Exhaustive lists for GRANT and DENY:** When using the `GRANT` or `DENY` commands, you must provide exhaustive lists of users. This means that the existing configuration will be replaced by the new list provided.

  For example:
  - First command:
    ```cypher
    GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER user1,user2 TO admin;
    ```
  - Second command (this overrides the first one):
    ```cypher
    GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER user3 TO admin;
    ```
    After the second command, the `admin` role will only be able to impersonate `user3`, even though the first command allowed impersonation of `user1` and `user2`.

- **Role-based permissions:** Permissions can be granted or denied to individual users or roles. For example, an `admin` role might have impersonation privileges that individual users do not have.

- **Revocation of permissions:** The `REVOKE` command removes any impersonation permissions for the specified user or role, ensuring that they cannot impersonate any user unless granted explicitly again.
