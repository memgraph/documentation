# Impersonate user (Enterprise)



The **impersonate user** feature lets authorized users run queries on behalf of
another user. When using impersonation, the permitted user adopts the full
permissions and context of the impersonated user. This means they can execute
queries and perform actions exactly as the impersonated user, with all
associated privileges.

This feature provides a powerful tool for managing user permissions, debugging,
and performing administrative tasks. By leveraging the ability to impersonate
other users, you can ensure more efficient management of users and roles while
maintaining robust security and access control within your graph database.

**Enterprise**: Impersonate user feature requires a Memgraph Enterprise license to
function. For more information on Memgraph Enterprise and instructions
on how to enable it, refer to the
[enabling Memgraph Enterprise documentation](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).

## Targeting impersonation

The impersonated user is defined at the session start, as shown in the example
using the Neo4j Python driver:

```python
with driver.session(impersonated_user="user1") as session:
    # queries here will be executed as if user1 executed them
```

During this session, all queries will be executed with the privileges and
context of the impersonated user (`user1` in this case), effectively "switching"
the identity for the duration of the session.

## Permissions for impersonation

Only certain users or roles have the ability to impersonate other users. These permissions are managed with three key queries:
- [`GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER`](#grant-impersonate-user)
- [`DENY IMPERSONATE_USER`](#deny-impersonate-user)
- [`REVOKE IMPERSONATE_USER`](#revoke-impersonate-user)

### Grant impersonate user

The `GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER` query allows a user or role to impersonate specific users or all users. The syntax and behavior are as follows:

```cypher
GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER [*] [list of users] TO user/role;
```

Here is the explanation of arguments:
- `*`: Grants permission to impersonate all users.
- `list of users`: Grants permission to impersonate specific users (comma-separated list).
- `user/role`: The user or role receiving the impersonation permission.

Here is an example of granting the `admin` role permission to impersonate `user1` and `user2`:
```cypher
GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER user1,user2 TO admin;
```

Here is an example of granting the `admin_user` user permission to impersonate all users:
```cypher
GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER * TO admin_user;
```

### Deny impersonate user

The `DENY IMPERSONATE_USER` denies impersonation rights to specific users or roles, allowing you to restrict who can impersonate whom.
The syntax and behavior are as follows:

```cypher
DENY IMPERSONATE_USER list of users TO user/role;
```

Here is the explanation of arguments:
- `list of users`: Deny impersonation for specific users (comma-separated list).
- `user/role`: The user or role being restricted from impersonating others.

Here is an example of denying the `admin` role the ability to impersonate `user1` and `user2`:
```cypher
DENY IMPERSONATE_USER user1,user2 TO admin;
```

### Revoke impersonate user

The `REVOKE IMPERSONATE_USER` removes the impersonation rights for a given user or role. It revokes all impersonation permissions for the specified user/role.
The syntax and behavior are as follows:

```cypher
REVOKE IMPERSONATE_USER FROM user/role;
```

Here is the explanation of arguments:
- `user/role`: The user or role whose impersonation permissions are being revoked.

Here is an example of revoking all impersonation permissions for the `admin` role:
```cypher
REVOKE IMPERSONATE_USER FROM admin;
```

<Callout type="info">
**Important things to note**

When using the `GRANT` or `DENY` commands, you must provide exhaustive lists of users. This means that the existing configuration will be replaced by the new list provided.
For example:
- First command:
  ```cypher
  GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER user1,user2 TO admin;
  ```
- Second command (this overrides the first one):
  ```cypher
  GRANT IMPERSONATE_USER user3 TO admin;
  ```
  After the second command, the `admin` role will only be able to impersonate `user3`, even though the first command allowed impersonation of `user1` and `user2`.

Permissions can be granted or denied to individual users or roles. For example, an `admin` role might have impersonation privileges that individual users do not have.
The `REVOKE` command removes any impersonation permissions for the specified user or role, ensuring that they cannot impersonate any user unless granted explicitly again.
