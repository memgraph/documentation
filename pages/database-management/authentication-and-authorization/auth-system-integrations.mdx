# Auth system integrations (Enterprise)

Memgraph supports authentication and authorization using external auth modules.
It includes built-in support for basic (username and password) authentication
via LDAP, as well as single sign-on over the SAML and OIDC protocols.

When a user is connecting, Memgraph will forward the user’s supplied
credentials (username and password, or scheme and auth response) to the
external auth module and retrieve its verdict. Based on this verdict, Memgraph
will either allow the user to connect or, in case of failure, close the
connection.

As this is an Enterprise feature, once the Memgraph Enterprise license expires,
newly created users will be granted all privileges. The existing users'
privileges will still apply but you won't be able to manage them.

## Configuration

### Roles

User roles must be defined in Memgraph before using auth modules because these
modules return the role associated with the user.

### Flags

Use the following configuration flags to configure the external auth module
authentication and authorization mechanisms used by Memgraph.

 Flag                               | Description
------------------------------------|------------
 `--auth-module-mappings`           | Associates auth schemes to external modules. A mapping is structured as follows: `<scheme>:<absolute path to module>` and individual entries are separated with `;`. If the mapping contains whitespace, enclose the flag value with quotation marks.
 `--auth-module-executable`         | [DEPRECATED] Path to the executable that should be used for user authentication/authorization. Replaced by `--auth-module-mappings=basic` from Memgraph 2.18.
 `--auth-module-timeout-ms`         | Specifies the maximum time that Memgraph will wait for a response from the external auth module.
 `--auth-password-permit-null`      | Can be set to false to disable null passwords.
 `--auth-password-strength-regex`   | The regular expression that should be used to match the entire entered password to ensure its strength.

Auth schemes that have built-in Memgraph support have default module paths. To
enable them, you only need to list the auth schemes themselves, e.g.
`--auth-module-mappings=basic;saml-entra-id;oidc-okta`.

The schemes with built-in support are:
* `basic` (username + password authentication with external module)
* `saml-entra-id`
* `saml-okta`
* `oidc-entra-id`
* `oidc-okta`

### Environment variables

The built-in auth modules (used with the `saml-entra-id`, `saml-okta`,
`oidc-entra-id`, and `oidc-okta` auth schemes) are further configured using
environment variables. See the individual SSO module sections for more detail.

## Auth module architecture

### Communication

Memgraph uses inter-process pipes to communicate with the module. The module
will receive auth requests on file descriptor `1000` and has to return auth
responses to file descriptor `1001`. The standard streams (`stdin` and `stdout`)
aren't used because external libraries often tend to write something to `stdout`
which is difficult to disable. By using separate file descriptors, `stdout` is
left intact and can be used freely for debugging purposes (along with `stderr`).

The protocol used between Memgraph and the module is as follows:
 - Each auth request is sent as a JSON encoded object in a single line that is
   terminated by a `\n`.
 - Each auth response must be sent as a JSON encoded object in a single line
   that is terminated by a `\n`.
 - Auth requests are objects that contain the following fields:
   - `basic` auth scheme:
    - `username` - the user's username
    - `password` - the user's password
   - other auth schemes:
    - `scheme` - the string representing the auth method, e.g. `oidc-entra-id`
    - `response` - the authentication response (e.g. SAML response or JWT)
 - Auth responses must be objects that contain the following fields:
   - `authenticated` - a `bool` indicating whether the user is allowed to log
     in to the database
   - `role` - a `string` indicating which role the user should have (must be
     supplied)
   - `errors` (optional) - if `authenticated` is false, Memgraph will put up a
     warning with the error message returned by the module

If the external auth module crashes during the processing of an auth request,
Memgraph won't allow the user to log in to the database and will automatically
restart the auth module for the next auth request. All crash logs will be seen
in Memgraph's output (typically in `systemd` logs using `journalctl`).

### Module example

This very simple example auth module is written in Python, but any programming
language can be used.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import json
import io


def authenticate(username, password):
    return {"authenticated": True, "role": "moderator"}


if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_stream = io.FileIO(1000, mode="r")
    output_stream = io.FileIO(1001, mode="w")
    while True:
        params = json.loads(input_stream.readline().decode("ascii"))
        ret = authenticate(**params)
        output_stream.write((json.dumps(ret) + "\n").encode("ascii"))
```

In the example you can see how the communication protocol works and you can see
the function that is used for authentication (and authorization). When writing
your own modules, you have to reimplement the `authenticate` function according
to your needs.

Because the authentication (and authorization) function has a simple signature,
it is easy (and recommended) to write unit (or integration) tests in separate
files. For example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import module

assert module.authenticate("sponge", "bob") == {"authenticated": True, "role": "analyst"}
assert module.authenticate("CHUCK", "NORRIS") == {"authenticated": True, "role": "admin"}
```

## Single sign-on

Single sign-on (SSO) lets you use an external ID to log in to Memgraph from
[Lab](data-visualization/user-manual/single-sign-on).

The built-in SSO modules let you customize which data from the identity service
supplies the username and password. Username configuration is service- and
protocol-specific, whereas role configuration works universally via remapping.

The `MEMGRAPH_SSO_{provider}_{protocol}_ROLE_MAPPING` flags define how the
identity service roles correspond to Memgraph’s.

The role mapping is defined as a string where individual mappings are separated
by a semicolon `;`. Each mapping is structured as follows:
`{identity service role}:{Memgraph role}`.

For example, the `entra.admin:memadmin; entra.user:memuser` mapping defines
that the identity service roles `entra.admin` and `entra.user` respectively map
to Memgraph’s `memadmin` and `memuser` roles.

<Callout type="info">

For correct operation, the Memgraph roles defined in the mapping need to be
created in the Memgraph DB beforehand.

</Callout>

### SAML

Memgraph has built-in support for single sign-on (SSO) over the SAML protocol
with the Microsoft Entra ID and Okta identity providers.

#### Configuration

To enable SAML SSO using the built-in auth modules, set the
`--auth-module-mappings` with the `saml-entra-id` or `saml-okta` schemes, e.g.
`--auth-module-mappings=saml-entra-id;saml-okta` (or just one of them).

The following environment variables are used to configure the built-in SAML
module:

##### Entra ID

* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_SAML_CALLBACK_URL`: the same as
  `AUTH_SAML_ENTRA_ID_CALLBACK_URL` for
  [Memgraph Lab](data-visualization/user-manual/single-sign-on#set-up-lab-integration)
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_SAML_ASSERTION_AUDIENCE`: the
  [application audience](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/msal-client-application-configuration#application-audience);
  for single-tenant apps, equal to `spn:{tenant id}`
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_SAML_SP_CERT`: the path to the application’s
  [SAML certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#set-up-authentication)
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_SAML_IDP_ID`: equal to `https://sts.windows.net/{tenant id}/`
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_SAML_USE_NAME_ID`: set to true in order to supply the
  username from the SAML NameID attribute
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_SAML_USERNAME_ATTRIBUTE`: if not using NameID, set the
  name of the SAML response attribute that contains the username
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_SAML_ROLE_MAPPING`: the [role mapping](#single-sign-on)

##### Okta

* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_SAML_CALLBACK_URL`: the same as
  `AUTH_SAML_OKTA_CALLBACK_URL` for
  [Memgraph Lab](data-visualization/user-manual/single-sign-on#set-up-lab-integration)
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_SAML_ASSERTION_AUDIENCE`: the
  [application audience](https://help.okta.com/oag/en-us/content/topics/access-gateway/add-app-saml-pass-thru-add-okta.htm)
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_SAML_SP_CERT`: the path to the application’s
  [SAML certificate](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/apps/manage-signing-certificates.htm)
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_SAML_IDP_ID`: the
  [Okta issuer URL](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/What-is-theIssuerlocated-under-the-OpenID-Connect-ID-Token-app-settings-used-for)
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_SAML_WANT_ATTRIBUTE_STATEMENT`: set to true if the Okta
  SAML response should contain attributes
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_SAML_USE_NAME_ID`: set to true in order to supply the
  username from the SAML NameID attribute
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_SAML_USERNAME_ATTRIBUTE`: if not using NameID, set the
  name of the SAML response attribute that contains the username
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_SAML_ROLE_ATTRIBUTE`: set the name of the SAML response
  attribute that contains the user role
* `MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_SAML_ROLE_MAPPING`: the [role mapping](#single-sign-on)

### OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Memgraph also supports authentication and authorization using OIDC (OIDC + OAuth 2.0) protocol with a
built-in auth module that is packaged with Memgraph Enterprise.

The module currently supports the following SSO providers:
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Okta using a custom authorization server

To use the built-in auth module run Memgraph with the `--auth-module-mappings` [flag](/database-management/configuration#auth-module) with the name of each provider and protocol you want to use separater with a semicolon (;).
For example, to use OIDC with both Entra ID and Okta run Memgraph with `--auth-module-mappings=oidc-okta;oidc-entra-id`.

For SSO provider setup see [this](/data-visualization/user-manual/single-sign-on).

#### Module requirements

The module is written in Python 3 and requires the following libraries:
 - `PyJWT` - used to validate tokens.
 - `requests` - used to retrieve public keys for validating tokens.
 - `cryptography` - used to parse tokens.

The required packages are already installed in the docker image. If you are using a native build you to install the packages manually on your machine.
The list of all required packages is located at `src/auth/reference_modules/requirements.txt`. You can install them by running `pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`.
If you are running a native build make sure that you don't have the Python `JWT` library installed (you can check that with `pip freeze`) as `PyJWT` and `JWT` have some conflicts.

#### Module configuration

The module is located at `/usr/lib/memgraph/auth_module/oidc.py`.
The module has no configuration file. You have to run Memgraph with some environmental variables.
To use multiple SSO providers you have to set the environmental variables associated with that provider.

##### MS Entra ID
For using OIDC with Microsoft Entra ID you have to set the following environmental variables:

```bash
MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_OIDC_TENANT_ID=
MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=
MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_OIDC_ROLE_MAPPING=
MEMGRAPH_SSO_ENTRA_ID_OIDC_USERNAME=
```

You can find the tenant and client ID in the app overview in Azure. For a more detailed explanation see [this](/pages/data-visualization/user-manual/single-sign-on.mdx).

Role mapping is described [here](#single-sign-on).

The username variable tells the OIDC module what to use as the username. It has the format `token-type:field`. 
Token type can be `id` or `access` depending on whether you want to use a field from the access or the ID token for the username. See the following to learn more about [access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/access-tokens) and [id](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/id-tokens) tokens.
By default, it is set to `id:sub` as per the OIDC protocol it is recommended to use the `sub` field from the id token as it is non-mutable and globally unique for each application.
For MS Entra ID one commonly used field is `id:preferred_username` which is usually the email of the user. For a list of all default claims look at [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/access-token-claims-reference) and [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/id-token-claims-reference).
You can also configure custom claims.

##### Okta

For using OIDC with Okta you have to set the following environmental variables:
```bash
MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_OIDC_ISSUER=
MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=
MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER=api://default
MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_OIDC_ROLE_MAPPING=
MEMGRAPH_SSO_OKTA_OIDC_USERNAME=
```

Role mapping is described [here](#single-sign-on).

Issuer is `https://{your-okta-domain}.okta.com/oauth2/default/`. You can find the client ID on the Admin panel -> Applications -> General. You can find the authorization server on the Admin panel -> Security -> API -> Authorization Servers -> Audience. By default, it is set to `api://default`.

##### Username 
The username variable tells the OIDC module what to use as the username. It has the format `token-type:field`. 
Token type can be `id` or `access` depending on whether you want to use a field from the access or the ID token for the username. See the following to learn more about [access](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/access-token/) and [id](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-id-tokens/main/#id-tokens-vs-access-tokens) tokens.
By default, it is set to `id:sub` as per the OIDC protocol it is recommended to use the `sub` field from the id token as it is non-mutable and globally unique for each application.
For Okta one commonly used field is `access:sub` which is usually the email of the user. You can also configure [custom claims](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/customize-tokens-returned-from-okta/main/).

#### Database configuration

OIDC is by default enabled using the Memgraph `oidc.py` module. To use a custom auth module use the `--auth-module-mappings` [flag](/database-management/configuration#auth-module) like the following:
`--auth-module-mappings=oidc-entra-id:/path/to/oidc-entra-module;oidc-okta:/path/to/oidc-okta-module` depending on the SSO provider you want to use.

## Basic (username + password) auth

When Memgraph is set up to use the external auth module for basic authentication
(`--auth-module-mappings=basic`), its internal users are automatically disabled.
Users are authenticated only using the module and existing local users are
ignored.

### LDAP

Memgraph also supports authentication and authorization using LDAP with a
built-in auth module that is packaged with Memgraph Enterprise.

The module supports the authentication and authorization (LDAP bind and search
requests) operation mode.

#### Mode of operation

When using LDAP authentication the module builds the DN used for authentication
using the user specified username and the following formula:

```plaintext
DN = prefix + username + suffix
```

In most common situations the `prefix` will be `cn=` and the `suffix` will be
`,dc=example,dc=com`. With an example username `alice` that would yield a DN
equal to `cn=alice,dc=example,dc=com` which will then be used for the LDAP bind
operation with the user specified password.

After the user is authenticated, the module searches through the role mapping
root DN object that contains role mappings. A role mapping object that has the
current bound user as its `member` attribute is used as the user's role.
The role that is mapped to the user is the `CN` attribute of the role mapping
object. The attribute that contains the user DN in the mapping object, as well
as the attribute that contains the role name, can be changed in the module
configuration file to accommodate your LDAP schema.

When searching for a role in directories that have thousands of roles,
the search process could take some time, causing long login times.

#### Module requirements

The module is written in Python 3 and it must be installed on the server. The
Python version should be at least `3.5`.  Also, you must have the following
Python 3 libraries installed:
 - `ldap3` - used to communicate with the LDAP server.
 - `PyYAML` - used to parse the configuration file.

#### Module configuration

The module configuration file is located at
`/etc/memgraph/auth_module/ldap.yaml`.  An initial example configuration file
that has all settings documented and explained is located at
`/etc/memgraph/auth_module/ldap.example.yaml`. For quick setup, you can copy the example
configuration file into the module configuration file.

#### Database configuration

In order to enable the use of the LDAP authentication and authorization module
you have to set the following flag: `--auth-module-mappings=basic`.

Other [flags](#configuration-flags) that change the behavior of the database to
module integration can be specified according to your needs.

#### Example

Organizations typically use an LDAP server to hold and manage the permissions.
Because LDAP servers are already set-up in most large organizations, it is
convenient for the organization to allow all staff members to have access to the
database using the already available centralized user management system.

For this guide let's assume that we have an LDAP server that is serving the
following data:

```plaintext
# Users root entry
dn: ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com
objectclass: organizationalUnit
objectclass: top
ou: people

# User dba
dn: cn=dba,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com
cn: dba
objectclass: person
objectclass: top
sn: user
userpassword: dba

# User alice
dn: cn=alice,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com
cn: alice
objectclass: person
objectclass: top
sn: user
userpassword: alice

# User carol
dn: cn=carol,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com
cn: carol
objectclass: person
objectclass: top
sn: user
userpassword: carol

# User dave
dn: cn=dave,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com
cn: dave
objectclass: person
objectclass: top
sn: user
userpassword: dave

# Roles root entry
dn: ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com
objectclass: organizationalUnit
objectclass: top
ou: roles

# Role superuser
dn: cn=superuser,ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com
cn: superuser
member: cn=dba,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com
objectclass: groupOfNames
objectclass: top

# Role moderator
dn: cn=moderator,ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com
cn: moderator
member: cn=alice,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com
objectclass: groupOfNames
objectclass: top

# Role admin
dn: cn=admin,ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com
cn: admin
member: cn=carol,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com
member: cn=dave,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com
objectclass: groupOfNames
objectclass: top
```

To summarize, the dataset contains the following data:
- `ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com` - entry that holds all users.
  - `cn=dba,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com` - user `dba` that will be used as the database administrator.
  - `cn=alice,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com` - regular user `alice`.
  - `cn=carol,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com` - regular user `carol`.
  - `cn=dave,ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com` - regular user `dave`.
- `ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com` - entry that holds all roles.
  - `cn=moderator,ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com` - role `moderator` that has `alice` as its member.
  - `cn=admin,ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com` - role `admin` that has `carol` and `dave` as its members.

#### Authentication

<Steps>

{<h3> Run Memgraph </h3>}

Firs, prepare Memgraph for the integration with LDAP. [Run a Memgraph
instance](/getting-started) without any users in its local authentication
storage. For more details on how the native authentication storage works in
Memgraph check [user privileges](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control).

{<h3> Create an administrator </h3>}

When using the module, all users are handled by the auth module and no user 
information is stored locally in Memgraph. In order to allow user login, the
corresponding roles need to be defined locally.

```cypher
CREATE ROLE superuser;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO superuser;
```

Once the role has been created and all privileges granted, it's safe to
disconnect from the database and proceed with the LDAP integration.

{<h3> Enable LDAP integration </h3>}

To enable LDAP integration specify the following flag:

```plaintext
--auth-module-mappings=basic
```

Also, add the following LDAP module configuration to
`/etc/memgraph/auth_module/ldap.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  host: "<LDAP_SERVER_HOSTNAME>"
  port: <LDAP_SERVER_PORT>
  encryption: "disabled"
  cert_file: ""
  key_file: ""
  ca_file: ""
  validate_cert: false

users:
  prefix: "cn="
  suffix: ",ou=people,dc=memgraph,dc=com"

roles:
  root_dn: ""
  root_objectclass: ""
  user_attribute: ""
  role_attribute: ""
```

Adjust the security settings according to your LDAP server security
settings.

Once all the configuration options are set, restart the Memgraph database
instance.

{<h3> Check the integration </h3>}

Verify that you can log into the database using the username `dba` and password
`dba`. It will confirm that the LDAP authentication is successfully enabled. 

{<h3> Log in other users </h3>}

User `alice` should be able to log in with password `alice`. 
The administrator `dba` should modify Alice's role's privileges to include the 
`MATCH` privilege using the following query:

```cypher
GRANT MATCH TO moderator;
```

Once Alice logs in the second time, she should be able to execute the following
query:

```cypher
MATCH (n) RETURN n;
```

If the `dba` runs the `SHOW USERS;` query, it won't return any users, since all 
users are managed by the auth module.

Users Bob, Carol and Dave will also be able to log in to the database using
their LDAP password.

</Steps>

#### Authorization

<Steps>

{<h3> Enable role mapping </h3>}

To enable role mapping for the described LDAP schema, modify the LDAP auth
module configuration file, specifically the section `roles`, by adding the
following content:

```yaml
roles:
  root_dn: "ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com"
  root_objectclass: "groupOfNames"
  user_attribute: "member"
  role_attribute: "cn"
```

This configuration tells the LDAP module that all role mapping entries are
children of the `ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com` entry, that the children have
user DNs specified in their `member` attribute and that the `cn` attribute
should be used to determine the role name.

When a user logs in to the database, the LDAP auth module will go through all
role mapping entries and will try to find out which role mapping entry has the
user as its member.

So now when Alice logs in, the LDAP auth module will go through the following
entries: `cn=admin,ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com` and
`cn=moderator,ou=roles,dc=memgraph,dc=com`. Because Alice is a member of the
`moderator` role mapping, the LDAP auth module will assign role moderator to
Alice.

{<h3> Adjust permissions </h3>}

Permissions for users and roles are still managed through Memgraph, they can't
be managed through the LDAP server.

The database administrator (user `dba`) now has to explicitly create the role
the users have so they will be able to log into the database:

```cypher
CREATE ROLE moderator;
```

In this scenario Alice and Bob will be able to log in. Alice will be
allowed to log in because her role (moderator) already exists. Carol and Dave 
won't be allowed to log in because their role (administrator) doesn't exist.

</Steps>
