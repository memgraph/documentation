scales, more advanced query optimization techniques are necessary. Also, a different set of queries is needed based on the use case,
which will be covered in the specific use case sections.

## Bringing Memgraph to Production

## 1. Hardware Requirements for Running Memgraph

To get started with Memgraph, we recommend checking the [system requirements](/getting-started/install-memgraph#system-requirements) listed
in our installation guide. These requirements are sufficient for setting up Memgraph on your own servers.

If you're deploying Memgraph using a cloud provider, visit the [deployment section](/deployment) for guidance on choosing the appropriate
instance type for your specific cloud environment.

## 2. Hardware Sizing

The most critical factor in provisioning a server for Memgraph is **RAM**. Memgraph operates primarily in **in-memory mode**, meaning
the entire dataset is loaded into RAM for optimal performance. Properly sizing your RAM is essential to ensuring your system runs efficiently
and can scale with your workload.

For a deeper dive into how memory usage is calculated, refer to our [memory storage documentation](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage). Below is a
simplified, rule-of-thumb approach to help you estimate your memory needs.

### Memory Components

Memgraph’s memory usage consists of five main parts:

1. **Node Memory**  
   Each node requires approximately **128 bytes**.

2. **Relationship Memory**  
   Each relationship requires approximately **120 bytes**.

3. **Property Storage**  
   Properties are stored in buffered arrays. The memory needed depends on property types and counts.

4. **Indices**  
   Additional overhead is introduced by indexing node labels, edge types, and properties.

5. **Query Execution Memory**  
   Temporary memory required to execute queries. This varies depending on the complexity of queries.

<Callout type="info">
Items 1–4 are referred to as **memory at rest**, while query execution memory is often called **compute memory**.
</Callout>

### RAM Sizing Guidelines

Use the following steps to estimate the RAM required for your workload:

#### Step 1: Estimate Base Graph Storage
For datasets with minimal properties (3–5 small properties), use this formula:
```
128 * N + 120 * R
```
Where:
- `N` = number of nodes
- `R` = number of relationships  
The result gives you the dataset size in **bytes**. The size of properties is ommitted as it will not impact the sizing.

<Callout type="info">
**Don’t know how many nodes or relationships you have?**  
If your data is in a non-graph format (e.g., CSV), estimating the number of nodes and relationships isn’t always straightforward.
For example, one line in a CSV file could represent a node, a relationship, or a mix of both. In some cases, nodes and relationships are
split into separate CSV files.

In such cases, we recommend importing a **sample of the dataset** (around 10%) into Memgraph and using the memory usage for that portion
to extrapolate the estimated requirements for the full dataset. This empirical method provides a more accurate and context-aware estimate
based on how your data is actually represented as a graph.
</Callout>

#### Step 2: Estimate Property Storage
If your dataset includes many or complex properties, refer to the [memory storage documentation](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage) for detailed
calculations. Add this result to the base graph size from Step 1.

#### Step 3: Add Index Overhead
- If you use fewer than 10 indices, this can be skipped.
- If you use many indices (e.g., 50+), add **~20% memory overhead** to the total from Steps 1 and 2.

#### Step 4: Add Query Execution Memory
- For basic querying without graph algorithms: **1.5× multiplier**
- For analytical workloads with algorithms (e.g., PageRank, Community Detection, Betweenness Centrality): **2× multiplier**

### Final Recommendation

Once you've completed these steps:

- Round up your estimate to match available server configurations.
- Example: If your estimate is **96GB**, choose a server with **128GB RAM** for safe headroom.

## 3. Hardware Configuration

One of the most important system settings when running Memgraph is configuring the kernel parameter `vm.max_map_count`.
This setting ensures that the system can allocate enough virtual memory areas, which is critical for avoiding memory-related
issues or unexpected crashes during Memgraph operations.

You can find detailed setup instructions and context in our 
[system configuration documentation](https://memgraph.com/docs/database-management/system-configuration#recommended-values-for-the-vmmax_map_count-parameter).

If you're deploying Memgraph on Kubernetes, our Helm charts include an **init container** that automatically sets `vm.max_map_count`
during startup. However, this container requires **root privileges** to execute. If you're running in a restricted environment
or prefer not to use privileged containers, you’ll need to **manually configure** this parameter on the host machine.

Properly configuring `vm.max_map_count` is a one-time setup but essential for a stable and performant Memgraph deployment.

For system-specific configuration steps and installation guidelines, refer to the [Install Memgraph guide](/getting-started/install-memgraph).

## 4. Networking Configuration

To ensure Memgraph functions properly in your environment, make sure the following ports are open and accessible on your server:

- **7687** – Used for the **Bolt protocol**, which handles all client-to-database communication.
- **3000** – Required if you're using **Memgraph Lab** as a visual interface.
- **7444** – Needed for **streaming logs** from Memgraph to Memgraph Lab.
- **9091** – Used for **system metrics**, an **Enterprise-only** feature. If you're using Prometheus or some other system for tracking system metrics,
this port needs to be enabled.

In addition to enabling these ports, be sure to:

- Review and adjust **firewall settings** to allow traffic on the listed ports.
- On **Red Hat-based systems**, even with the firewall properly configured, you might need to **disable SELinux**, as it can block
Memgraph’s access to system resources.

## 5. Deployment Options

Memgraph can be deployed in two main ways: **natively** as a `.deb` or `.rpm` package on various Linux distributions, 
or **containerized** using Docker on any operating system. While native installation can offer up to **10% better performance**,
we generally recommend using the **containerized version**—whether via **Docker**, **Kubernetes manifests**, or **Helm charts**.

When deploying via Helm, users can choose between:
- The **Memgraph Standalone Helm chart** – ideal if you're working with a **single instance** setup.
- The **Memgraph High Availability Helm chart** – designed for **production deployments** that require **redundancy and failover**
  with multiple instances.

The containerized deployment comes pre-packaged with all **MAGE algorithms** and utility tools, eliminating the need for 
additional setup. In contrast, native installations require users to **compile C++ modules** and **manually install Python packages**
to enable the full range of MAGE functionalities—an often complex and error-prone process for most users.

For most use cases, especially during prototyping and production readiness, the containerized image provides the best balance between
**performance**, **simplicity**, and **feature completeness**.

More details and installation instructions can be found in the [Install Memgraph guide](/getting-started/install-memgraph).

## 6. Choosing the right Memgraph flag set

Memgraph offers a variety of configuration flags to tailor its behavior based on your environment and use case. Here are the most important 
flags to consider:

- `--log-level`  
  This flag controls the granularity of Memgraph's logs. In **production environments**, setting it to `INFO` or `DEBUG` 
  is typically sufficient. For **diagnostics or experimentation**, using `TRACE` provides highly detailed logs 
  that can help in troubleshooting—but keep in mind this will significantly increase **disk usage**. 
  Memgraph **does not automatically delete old logs**, so you’ll need to manage log retention manually. This flag can be
  adjusted at runtime using the `SET DATABASE SETTING 'log.level' TO 'value'` command.

- `--also-log-to-stderr=true`  
  Enables logging to **standard error** in addition to log files.

<Callout type="info">
  Optionally, users can manually stream the logs to another system such as **Splunk**, or using a containerized setup where
  logs are collected from standard output streams.
</Callout>

- `--storage-parallel-schema-recovery=true` and `--storage-recovery-thread-count=x`  
  These flags enable **parallel recovery** of the schema during startup. Set `x` to the number of cores you want to dedicate
  for recovery. This significantly speeds up the time it takes for Memgraph to become operational after a restart.

- `--memory-limit=x` (in MiB)  
  This flag defines the **maximum memory** Memgraph can use. By default, it's set to **90% of available system memory**, but if 
  you're running other processes on the same machine (like Memgraph Lab or others), it's advisable to **manually lower this limit**.
  On Kubernetes, node memory is often shared with system components like **kubelets**, so the flag should be set to a value lower
  than the actual available memory on the node.

<Callout type="info">

## 7. Choosing the Right Memgraph Storage Mode

Memgraph currently supports two fully-featured and production-ready storage modes:  
- `IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL`  
- `IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL`

A third mode, `ON_DISK_TRANSACTIONAL`, is still **experimental** and lacks many production-grade features.
While it's part of Memgraph’s long-term roadmap, it’s **not recommended for production** use at this stage.

For all current production deployments, users are strongly encouraged to choose either the **in-memory transactional** or
**in-memory analytical** mode, based on the nature of their workload.

You can set the storage mode in two ways:
- Via a **Cypher query**:
  ```cypher
  STORAGE MODE IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL;
  -- or --
  STORAGE MODE IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL;
  ```
- Or by using a **configuration flag** at startup:
  ```cypher
  --storage-mode=IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL
  --storage-mode=IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL
  ```

### Which Mode Should You Choose?

- ✅ **Transactional Mode (`IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL`)**  
  Ideal for **mission-critical workloads** requiring **ACID guarantees**, **replication**, and **high availability**.
  This mode supports safe concurrent access, durability, and rollback on failure.  
  Keep in mind that **write-write conflicts** can occur and may need to be retried on the driver side.

- 🚀 **Analytical Mode (`IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL`)**  
  Suited for **read-only** workloads or **on-demand graph analytics** where you need **multithreaded ingestion at scale**.
  This mode supports extremely high write throughput, even reaching **millions of writes per second**, thanks to parallelized graph construction.  
  However, it **does not support aborting or rolling back transactions**, as it does not track changes via delta objects.
  Once a write is made, it becomes part of the current state.

<Callout type="info">
**Rule of thumb**:  
Use **analytical mode** for high-speed, read-heavy, or bulk-ingest scenarios.  
Use **transactional mode** for anything requiring **reliability, consistency, or fault tolerance**.
</Callout>

## 8. Importing Mechanisms

Memgraph supports a variety of data importing mechanisms to help you efficiently bring your data into the graph. Whether
you're working with CSV files, JSON streams, Kafka topics, or external data sources, choosing the right import strategy is key to a smooth migration.

We strongly encourage users to review the [best practices for data migration](/data-migration/best-practices),
which cover recommendations and tips to ensure a reliable and performant data import process tailored to Memgraph.

## 9. Enterprise Features You Might Require

Memgraph provides a rich set of **enterprise-grade features** designed to support production workloads at scale. These include:

- **High Availability (HA)** and **automatic failover** for fault tolerance  
- **System metrics monitoring** for observability and performance tracking  
- **Role-based and fine-grained access control** for secure, multi-user environments  
- **Multi-tenancy** for isolating and managing separate workloads within the same infrastructure  
- **Advanced security features** to meet compliance and operational requirements  

There are additional enterprise capabilities as well, tailored for advanced performance, scalability, and security needs.
We recommend exploring the other chapters in the **"Memgraph in Production"** guide series, as they highlight how these
features can be aligned with your specific use cases.

Memgraph Enterprise License is enabled by issueing the following queries:
```
SET DATABASE SETTING 'organization.name' TO 'Organization';
SET DATABASE SETTING 'enterprise.license' TO 'License';
```

However, the recommended way of specifying the Enterprise License would be through environment variables through Docker or making
it visible to the process (if you're deploying Memgraph natively).

```
MEMGRAPH_ORGANIZATION_NAME=Organization
MEMGRAPH_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE=License
```

Reason for that is because environment variables always override any system settings that are set via queries.

[section on Memgraph Enterprise enablement](/database-management/enabling-memgraph-enterprise).
</Callout>


## 10. Queries That Best Suit Your Workload

Memgraph fully supports the **Cypher query language**, making it easy to express complex graph patterns. In addition to Cypher,
Memgraph has **built-in path traversal capabilities** at the core of the database, enabling **lightning-fast traversals** optimized for
performance-critical use cases. You can learn more about these in our
[Deep Path Traversal guide](/advanced-algorithms/deep-path-traversal).

For advanced analytics and utility functions, Memgraph also ships with the
**[MAGE library](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms)**, which includes a wide range of pre-built
**graph algorithms** and **procedures** for tasks like community detection, centrality scoring, node similarity, and more.

We encourage users to explore the other guides in the **"Memgraph in Production"** series, where you'll find detailed examples and
recommendations on which types of queries are most effective based on your specific **workload and use case**.
