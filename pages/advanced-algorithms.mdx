# Advanced algorithms

If you require procedures designed to solve specific graph problems, check the
**Memgraph Advanced Graph Extensions** (**MAGE**) library. It is an
[**open-source repository**](https://github.com/memgraph/mage) that contains
**graph algorithms** written by the team behind Memgraph and its users in the
form of **query modules**. The project aims to give everyone the tools they need
to tackle the most interesting and challenging **graph analytics** problems.

[**Query
module**](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms/available-algorithms) is a
concept introduced by Memgraph and it refers to user-defined procedures, grouped
into modules that extend the **Cypher query language**. Procedures are
implementations of various algorithms in multiple programming languages and they
are all runnable inside Memgraph.

## Quick start

<Steps>

### 1. Install MAGE

If you started Memgraph with the `memgraph-platform` or `memgraph-mage` Docker
image, MAGE is already included and you can skip to step 3.

The execution of graph algorithms can be accelerated with the GPU, by using the
[Memgraph X NVIDIA cuGraph](/advanced-algorithms/install-mage) version of the library. 

If you are using Linux, you can [install MAGE from
source](/advanced-algorithms/install-mage).

### 2. Load query modules

To use certain procedures, first, you need to [load the query modules](/custom-query-modules/manage-query-modules) to the
appropriate directory. 

### 3. Call procedures

You are ready to [call procedures](/advanced-algorithms/run-algorithms) within queries and tackle that graph analytics
problem that's been keeping you awake. 

</Steps>

## Memgraph compatibility

With changes in Memgraph API, MAGE started to track version numbers. Check out
MAGE compatibility with Memgraph versions.

| MAGE version | Memgraph version  |
|--------------|-------------------|
| >= 1.6       | >= 2.5.2          |
| >= 1.4       | >= 2.4.0          |
| >= 1.0       | >= 2.0.0          |
| ^0           | >= 1.4.0 &lt;= 1.6.1 |


## What to do next?

### Check available graph algorithms and modules

Utilize the [currently available query
modules](/advanced-algorithms/available-algorithms).

### Create query modules

You can create your own graph algorithms and query modules using C/C++ or
Python, and contribute them to the MAGE library.
