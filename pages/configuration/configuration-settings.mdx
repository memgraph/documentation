# Configuration settings

The main Memgraph configuration file is available in
`/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`. You can modify that file to suit your specific
needs. Additional configuration can be specified by including another
configuration file, in a file pointed to by the `MEMGRAPH_CONFIG` environment
variable or by passing arguments on the command line.

When working with Memgraph Platform Docker image, you should pass configuration
flags inside of environment variables.

For example, you can start the `memgraph` Docker image with `docker run
memgraph/memgraph --bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE`, but you should start
`memgraph-platform` Docker image with `docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -p
3000:3000 -e MEMGRAPH="--bolt-port=7687 --log-level=TRACE"
memgraph/memgraph-platform`.

Each configuration setting is in the form: `--setting-name=value`.

You can check the current configuration by using the following query (privilege
level `CONFIG` is required):
```opencypher
SHOW CONFIG;
```

If you are using a multi-tenant architecture, all isolated databases share
identical configurations. At the moment, there is no way to specify a
per-database configuration.

## Additional configuration inclusion

You can define additional configuration files in the main configuration file or
within a Docker command in the terminal. Additional files are processed after
the main configuration file and they override the main configuration file.
Additional configuration files are specified with the `--flag-file` flag.

Example:

 `--flag-file=another.conf`

## Change the configuration

Changing the configuration settings for Memgraph differes if you are using
Memgraph with **Docker** or if it was installed with **Linux** - Ubuntu,
Debian, RPM package, or WSL.


<Tabs items={["Docker", "Linux"]}>

    <Tab>

        You can customize the configuration by
        passing configuration options within the `docker run` command.

        If you are working with the `memgraph-platform` image, you should pass
        configuration options with environment variables.

        For example, if you want to limit memory usage for the whole instance to 50 MiB
        and set the log level to `TRACE`, pass the configuration like this:

        ```
        docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 3000:3000 -p 7444:7444 -e MEMGRAPH="--memory-limit=50 --log-level=TRACE" memgraph/memgraph-platform
        ```

        When you are working with `memgraph` or `memgraph-mage` images, you should pass
        configuration options as arguments.

        For example, if you want to limit memory usage for the whole instance to 50 MiB
        and set the log level to `TRACE`, pass the configuration argument like this:

        ```
        docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph --memory-limit=50 --log-level=TRACE
        ```
        ---

        You can also change the configuration within the configuration file:

        <Steps>

            ### Start Memgraph 

            Start Memgraph with a `docker run` command. 

            ### Find container ID

            Open a new terminal and find the `CONTAINER ID` of the Memgraph Docker container
            using the following command:

            ```console
            docker ps
            ```

            ### Enter the continer

            Enter the Docker container with the following command:

            ```plaintext
            docker exec -it -u 0 <CONTAINER ID> bash
            ```

            ### Install the text editor of your choice

            For example, if you want to use `vim` run:

            ```console
            apt-get update
            apt-get install vim
            ```

            ### Edit the configuration file 

            The file is located at `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`.

            ### Restart the intance

            Run the following command: 

            ```
            docker restart <CONTAINER ID>
            ```

        </Steps>

    </Tab>
    <Tab>

        After installing Memgraph, the configuration file is available at `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`.

        Modify it, save the changes and restart the instance.
