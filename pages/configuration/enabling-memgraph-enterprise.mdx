#  Enabling Memgraph Enterprise

The following Memgraph features are only available in Enterprise Edition:
- [Audit log](/configuration/audit-log)
- [External auth module](/configuration/auth-module)
- [LDAP support](/configuration/auth-module#ldap)
- [Monitoring via HTTP server](/configuration/monitoring-server#monitoring-via-http-server-enterprise)
- [Multi-tenancy](/configuration/multi-tenancy)
- [Role-based access control](/configuration/security#role-based-access-control-enterprise)
- [Label-based access control](/configuration/security#label-based-access-control-enterprise)

 They are present in the same binary but protected by a license key.

If you're interested in the Memgraph Enterprise Trial, you need to fill out the
following [form](https://memgraph.com/enterprise-trial) where one of the fields
is the organization name.

Whether you bought Memgraph Enterprise or requested a trial, you will recieve a
file with the values you need to set the `organization.name` and the
`enterprise.license` confgiuration values to.

If you want to enable the Enterprise Edition on startup, [set the configuration
flags](/configuration/configuration-settings#change-the-configuration) to the
correct values. 

If you are already running Memgraph Community Edition, these configuration flags
can also be adjusted [during
runtime](/configuration/configuration-settings#during-runtime), or you can run
the following queries to set the values:

```
SET DATABASE SETTING 'organization.name' TO 'Organzation';
SET DATABASE SETTING 'enterprise.license' TO 'License';
```

To check the set values run: 

```opencypher√¶
SHOW DATABASE SETTING 'organization.name';
SHOW DATABASE SETTING 'enterprise.license';
```

or:

```opencypher
SHOW DATABASE SETTINGS;
```

## Upgrading or downgrading the license

Memgraph licenses are issued based on the maximum unique data stored. So, if you
get a 1TB license, you can store 1TB of data. When you reach that capacity you
will no longer be able to run `write` queries, only `read` and `delete` queries.

At that point, you can upgrade your license and the `write` queries will be
enabled when you enter the new license key like.

To check the used storage, run `SHOW STORAGE INFO;`.

## License key expiry

Once the license key expires, the enterprise features will stop working, but the
data stored in the database will stay intacted.
