# Data durability and backup

Memgraph uses two mechanisms to ensure the durability of stored data and make
disaster recovery possible:

* write-ahead logging (WAL)
* periodic snapshot creation

These mechanisms generate **durability files** and save them in the respective
`wal` and `snapshots` folders in the **data directory**. Data directory stores
permanent data on-disk. 

The default data directory path is `/var/lib/memgraph` but the path can be
changed by [modifying the `data-dir` configuration
flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#other).

If you are using a multi-tenant architecture, the `data_directory` also houses
databases within `/data_directory/databases/*db_name*`.

Durability files are deleted when certain events are triggered, for example,
exceeding the maximum number of snapshots, defined by the
`--storage-snapshot-retention-count=3` flag.

To prevent the deletion of durability files, you need to lock the `data
directory`, and enable it again by unlocking the directory.

To manage this behavior, use the following queries:

```cypher
LOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
UNLOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
```

To show the status of the data directory, run:

```cypher
DATA DIRECTORY LOCK STATUS;
```

To encrypt the data directory, use
[LUKS](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/) as it works with Memgraph out
of the box and is undetectable from the applications perspective so it shouldn't
break any existing applications. 

## Durability mechanisms

To configure the durability mechanisms check their respective configuration
flags in the [configuration settings](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage). 

### Write-ahead logging

Write-ahead logging (WAL) is a technique applied in providing **atomicity** and
**durability** to database systems. 

In the default IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL [storage
mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#storage-modes), Memgraph creates a
`Delta` object each time data is changed. By using Deltas, Memgraph creates
write-ahead logs. Each database modification is therefore recorded in a log file
before being written to the DB, and in the end the log file contains all steps
needed to reconstruct the DB’s most recent state.

Memgraph has WAL enabled by default. To switch it on and off, use the boolean
`--storage-wal-enabled` flag. For other WAL-related flags check the [configuration
reference guide](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage).

WAL files are usually located at `/var/lib/memgraph/wal`.

### Snapshots
Snapshots provide a faster way to restore the states of your database. Snapshots
are created periodically based on the value defined with the
`--storage-snapshot-interval-sec` configuration flag, as well as upon exit based
on the value of the `--storage-snapshot-on-exit` configuration flag.  When a
snapshot creation is triggered, the entire data storage is written to the drive.
Nodes and relationships are divided into groups called batches.

On startup, the database state is recovered from the most recent snapshot file.
Memgraph can read the data and build the indexes on multiple threads, using
batches as a parallelization unit: each thread will recover one batch at a time
until there are no unhandled batches.

This means the same batch size might not be suitable for every dataset. A
smaller dataset might require a smaller batch size to utilize a multi-threaded
processor, while bigger datasets might use bigger batches to minimize the
synchronization between the worker threads. Therefore the size of batches and
the number of used threads [are
configurable](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage) similarly to
other durability related settings.

The timestamp of the snapshot is compared with the latest update recorded in the
WAL file and, if the snapshot is less recent, the state of the DB will be
recovered using the WAL file.

Memgraph has snapshot creation enabled by default. You can configure the exact
snapshot creation behavior by [defining the relevant flags](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage).
Alternatively, you can make one directly by running the following query:

```opencypher
CREATE SNAPSHOT;
```
Snapshot files are saved inside the `snapshots` directory located in the data directory
(`var/lib/memgraph`). 

<Callout type="warning">
Snapshots and WAL files are presently not compatible between Memgraph versions.
</Callout>


## Create backup

Follow these steps to create database backup:

<Steps>

{<h3>Create a snapshot</h3>}

  If necessary, create a snapshot of the current database state by running the
  following query in `mgconsole` or Memgraph Lab:

  ```cypher
  CREATE SNAPSHOT;
  ```
  The snapshot is saved in the `snapshots` directory of the data directory
  (`/var/lib/memgraph`).

{<h3>Lock the data directory</h3>}

  Durability files are deleted when an event is triggered, for example, exceeding
  the maximum number of snapshots.

  To disable this behavior, run the following query in `mgconsole` or Memgraph
  Lab:

  ```cypher
  LOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
  ```

{<h3>Copy files</h3>}

  Copy snapshot files (from the `snapshots` directory) and any additional WAL
  files (from the `wal` directory) to a backup location.

  If you've just created a snapshot file there is no need to backup WAL files. 

  To copy the snapshot files from the Docker container first check the container
  ID by running `docker ps` then run the following command:

   ```plaintext
    docker cp  <CONTAINER ID>:/var/lib/memgraph/<snapshot_file> <snapshot_file>
   ```

{<h3>Unlock the data directory</h3>}

  Run the following query in `mgconsole` or Memgraph Lab to unlock the
  directory:

  ```cypher
  UNLOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
  ```

  Memgraph will delete the files which should have been deleted before locking and
  allow any future deletion of the durability files.

## Restore data

Follow these steps to restore data from a backup:

<Tab>

<Steps>

{<h3>Empty the `wal` directory</h3>}

  If you want to restore data only from the snapshot file, ensure that the
  `wal` directory is empty:

     1. Find the container ID using a `docker ps` command, then enter the container using:

      ```
      docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
      ```
     2. Position yourself in the `/var/lib/memgraph/wal` directory and `rm *`

{<h3>Stop the instance</h3>}

  Run the following command
  
  ```
  docker stop CONTAINER_ID
  ```

{<h3>Start the instance</h3>}

  You can start the instance with the backed up files in two ways.

  {<h4>Option 1</h4>}

  You can start the instance by adding a `-v
  ~/snapshots:/var/lib/memgraph/snapshots` flag to the `docker run` command,
  where the `~/snapshots` represents a path to the location of the directory
  with the back-up snapshot, for example: 

  ```
  docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v ~/snapshots:/var/lib/memgraph/snapshots memgraph/memgraph
  ```

  If you want to copy both WAL and snapshot files start the instance by adding
  a `-v ~/snapshots:/var/lib/memgraph/snapshots -v ~/wal:/var/lib/memgraph/wal`
  flags to the `docker run` command, where the `~/snapshots` represents a path
  to the location of the backed-up snapshot directory, and `~/wal` represents a
  path to the location of the backed-up wal directory for example: 

  ```
  docker run -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v ~/snapshots:/var/lib/memgraph/snapshots -v ~/wal:/var/lib/memgraph/wal memgraph/memgraph
  ```

  {<h4>Option 2</h4>}

  The other option is to copy the backed-up snapshot file into the `snapshots`
  directory after creating the container and start the database. So the commands
  should look like this: 

  ```
  docker create -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 -v `snapshots`:/var/lib/memgraph/snapshots --name memgraphDB memgraph/memgraph
  tar -cf - sample_snapshot_file | docker cp -a - memgraphDB:/var/lib/memgraph/snapshots
  ```
  The `sample_snapshot_file` is the snapshot file you want to use to restore the
  data. Due to the nature of Docker file ownership, you need to use `tar` to
  copy the file as STDIN into the non-running container. It will allow you to
  change the ownership of the file to the `memgraph` user inside the container.

  After that, start the database with:
  ```
  docker start -a memgraphDB
  ```
  The `-a` flag is used to attach to the container's output so you can see the logs.

  Once memgraph is started, change the snapshot directory ownership to the `memgraph` user by running the following command:
  ```
  docker exec -it -u 0 memgraphDB bash -c "chown memgraph:memgraph /var/lib/memgraph/snasphots"
  ```
  Otherwise, Memgraph will not be able to write the future snapshot files and will fail.

</Steps>

<Steps>

{<h3>Copy the durability files</h3>}

Before running an instance, copy the backed up snapshot into the `snapshots`
directory, and optionally, copy the backed-up WAL files into the `wal`
directory.

If you are restoring data only from the snapshot file, ensure that the file you
   want to use to restore the data is the only snapshot file in the `snapshots`
   directory and that the `wal` directory is empty. 
   
If you are restoring data
   from both the snapshot and WAL files, ensure they are the only files in the
   `snapshot` and `wal` directories. 

{<h3>Start the database</h3>}

## Database dump

The database dump contains a record of the database state in the form of Cypher
queries. It’s equivalent to the SQL dump in relational DBs. 

You can run the queries constituting the dump to recreate the state of the DB as
it was at the time of the dump.

To dump the Memgraph DB, run the following query:

```opencypher
DUMP DATABASE;
```
If you are using Memgraph Lab, you can dump the database, that is, the queries
to recreate it, to a CYPHERL file in the `Import & Export` section of the Lab.

## Storage modes

Memgraph has the option to work in `IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL`,
`IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL` or `ON_DISK_TRANSACTIONAL` [storage
modes](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage.md).

Memgraph always starts in the `IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL` mode in which it creates
periodic snapshots and write-ahead logging as durability mechanisms, and also
enables creating manual snapshots.

In the `IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL` mode, Memgraph offers no periodic snapshots and
write-ahead logging. Users can create a snapshot with the `CREATE SNAPSHOT;`
Cypher query. During the process of snapshot creation, other transactions will
be prevented from starting until the snapshot creation is completed.

In the `ON_DISK_TRANSACTIONAL` mode, durability is supported by RocksDB since it
keeps its own
[WAL](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Write-Ahead-Log-%28WAL%29) files.
Memgraph persists the metadata used in the implementation of the on-disk
storage.
