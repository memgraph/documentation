# High availability

Cluster is considered highly available if at any point there is some instance which can respond to user query. Our high availability 
relies on replication. The cluster is consisted of main instance on which user can execute write queries, replica instances
which can only respond to read queries and of coordinators which manage cluster state. In 2.15 release the cluster is highly available
in a sense that there will always be consistent main instance on which user can write but coordinator is implemented only as a single
instance for which we assume that it cannot fail. We are working on introducing NuRaft to connect coordinator instances to a Raft cluster
so that any point there is an active coordinator which can correctly manage cluster state.

## Cluster management

You can start coordinator instance by specifying `--raft-server-id` and `--raft-server-port` flags. Coordinator instance only responds to
queries related to high availability so you cannot execute any data-oriented query on it. Raft server port is used for RAFT protocol which
all coordinators are using to ensure consistenty of cluster's state. Replication instance is distinguished from coordinator instance by
specifying `--coordinator-server-port` flag. This port is used for RPC network communication that happens between coordinators and replication
instance. When started by default replication instance is MAIN. Once all instances are started, the user can start registering replication instances.

### Register instance

Register instance query will result in several actions:
1. Coordinator instance will connect to replication instance 
2. Coordinator instance will start pinging replication instance every `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec` seconds to check 
the status of replication instance.
3. Replication instance will be demoted from main to replica.
4. Replication instance will by default by replica in sync with main which will start replication server on replicationSocketAddress specified in the query.

Both coordinator and replication socket address need to be unique.

```plaintext
REGISTER INSTANCE instanceName ON coordinatorSocketAddress ( AS ASYNC ) ? WITH replicationSocketAddress ;
```

### Set instance to main

Once all instances are registered, one replication instance should be promoted to main. This can be achieved by using following query:

```plaintext
SET INSTANCE instanceName to MAIN;
```

This query will register all other instances as replicas to the new main. 
TODO: What will happen if some instance is unavailable now fico?

If there is already main instance in the cluster, this query will fail. 


### Unregister instance

There are various reasons which could lead to the decision that an instance needs to be removed from the cluster. The hardware can be broken,
network communication could be wrongly setup etc. The user can remove instance from the cluster using following query:

```plaintext
UNREGISTER INSTANCE instanceName;
```

At the moment of registration, the instance which you want to unregister must not be main because unregistering main could lead to cluster which
is in inconsistent state.

### Show instances

You can check the state of the whole cluster using `SHOW INSTANCES` query. The query will show what instances are visible in the cluster,
which raft port are they using (single coordinator for now), which coordinator port are they using, are they considered alive from coordinator's
perspective and which role do they have (are they main, replica, coordinator or unknown if not alive).

```plaintext
SHOW INSTANCES;
```

## Setting config for highly-available cluster

Memgraph's 2.15 release added several flags to user for managing cluster. Flag `--coordinator-server-port` is used for distinguishing replication instances
from coordinators. The provided flag needs to be unique. Setting flag will result in creating RPC server on replication instances capable of 
responding to coordinator's RPC messages. 
Flags `--raft-server-id` and `--raft-server-port` need to be unique and specified on coordinator instances. They will cause creation of RAFT 
server used for communication of coordinator instances. Flag `--instance-health-check-frequency-sec` specifies how often should leader coordinator
check status of replication instance to update its status. Flag `--instance-down-timeout-sec` gives user the ability to control how much time should
pass before coordinator starts considering instance to be down. We advise user to consider instance to be down only if several consecutive pings
failed because a single ping can fail because of a million reasons.
