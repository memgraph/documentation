# Logs

The default location of logs is `/var/log/memgraph/memgraph.log` but it can be
changed using the `--log-file` [configuration flag](/configuration/configuration-settings#other).

Memgraph tracks logs at various levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR,
CRITICAL. By default, it is using the WARNING level, but you can change the
level using the [`--log-level`](/configuration/configuration-settings#other)
configuration file or [during
runtime](/configuration/configuration-settings#during-runtime) using the `SET
DATABASE SETTING "log.level" TO "WARNING";`

The configuration set during runtime will be applied only for that session.

You can check the log level by running `SHOW DATABASE SETTING "log.level";` query.

If you are using Memgraph Lab, you can access the Logs from the interface if the
port 7444 was exposed when running the instance. 

## Access logs

If you installed Memgraph with Linux, logs can be found in the
`/var/log/memgraph` directory.

If you installed Memgraph using Docker:

<Steps>

    ### Find container ID
    
    Open a new terminal and find the `CONTAINER ID` of the Memgraph Docker
    container:

    ```plaintext
    docker ps
    ```

    ### Enter the container

    Run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> bash
    ```

    Be sure to replace the `<CONTAINER ID>` parameter.

    ### List the `/var/log/memgraph` directory
    
    Position yourself in the `/var/log/memgraph` directory.

    ```plaintext
    ls /var/log/memgraph
    ```

    ### List the content of the log 
    
    To list the content of the log, use the `cat /var/log/memgraph/<memgraph_date>.log` command.

    For example, if the `ls` command returned `memgraph_2022-03-04.log` you would
    list the contents using the following command:

    ```plaintext
    cat /var/log/memgraph/memgraph_2022-03-04.log
    ```

    #### Filtering unnecessary log messages

    Memgrpah uses several differnt types of log files:
    - General Logs: These are the default logs that track various levels such as `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. 
    - Audit Logs: These logs contain [records of all queries](/configuration/audit-log) executed on the database when enabled.
    - Write-ahead Logs (WAL): These logs record [each database modification](/configuration/data-durability-and-backup) before it's written to the database, helping to reconstruct the database's most recent state.

    When you use Memgraph's log files, you might find too many details that make it
    hard to spot the important messages. To make analyzing the logs easier, you can
    use a tool suach as `grep` to remove the messages you don't need. For instance,
    if you want to ignore messages about internal Memgraph Lab work or too much information
    on storage, indexes, rules, and triggers, you can use this grep command:

    ```bash
    grep -v -E "SHOW STORAGE INFO|APP_INTERNAL_EXEC_VAR|SHOW INDEX INFO|SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO|SHOW TRIGGERS" /var/log/memgraph/memgraph_2022-03-04.log
    ```

    This command excludes log lines containing `SHOW STORAGE INFO`, any occurrences
    of `APP_INTERNAL_EXEC_VAR`, `SHOW INDEX INFO`, `SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO`, and `SHOW
    TRIGGERS`, making it easier to focus on the messages that are most relevant to
    your monitoring and troubleshooting efforts.

    Note: Replace `/var/log/memgraph/memgraph_2022-03-04.log` with the actual path to your log
    file.

    ### Save logs locally
    
    If you want to save the log to your computer, exit the container with
    `CTRL+D` or `exit`, place yourself in a directory where you want to save the copy and run
    the following command:

    ```plaintext
    docker cp  <CONTAINER ID>:/var/log/memgraph/<memgraph_date>.log <memgraph_date>.log
    ```

    For example, the following command will make a copy of the
    `memgraph_2022-03-04.log` file on the user's desktop:

    ```plaintext
    C:\Users\Vlasta\Desktop>docker cp bb3de2634afe:/var/log/memgraph/memgraph_2022-03-04.log memgraph_2022-03-04.log

    ```
