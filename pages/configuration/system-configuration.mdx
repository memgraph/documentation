# System Configuration

Enhancing Memgraph's performance can sometimes involve optimizing operating
system-level configurations. These adjustments primarily pertain to the settings
governing resource allocation and process management.

## Adjusting fs.file-max

The `fs.file-max` parameter in Linux sets the maximum number of file handles
that the Linux kernel will allocate. Adjusting this is crucial when the system
needs to handle numerous open files simultaneously. To adjust this parameter do the following: 

<Steps>

{<h3>Open `/etc/sysctl.conf` in a text editor</h3>}
You need root privileges to edit this file, which is used for configuring kernel
parameters at runtime.

{<h3>Set the file handle limit</h3>}
Add the line `fs.file-max=100000` to `sysctl.conf`. 

{<h3>Apply the changes</h3>}
Save your changes and exit the text editor. Run `sudo sysctl -p` to immediately
apply the changes without rebooting.

{<h3>Verify the changes</h3>}
Run `sysctl fs.file-max` to check that the new value has been applied. It should
return `100000`.

</Steps>

## Increasing memory map areas

The `vm.max_map_count` parameter determines the maximum number of memory map
areas a process can have. Run `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144` to
immediately increase the memory map area limit to 262,144. This change takes
effect right away but lasts only until the next reboot.

If you want a change that persists across system reboots, follow these steps:

<Steps>

{<h3>Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf`</h3>}
Add `vm.max_map_count=262144` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Root privileges are
required for editing.

{<h3>Apply the changes</h3>}
Save your changes and run `sudo sysctl -p` to apply them right away.

{<h3>Verify the changes</h3>}
Run `sysctl vm.max_map_count` to ensure the new value is in effect. It should
return `262144`.

</Steps>

## Setting the process stack size

For systems running resource-intensive applications, it might be necessary to
increase the stack size for a process. By default, the Linux stack size is set
to 8MB. Increasing this limit can help in managing larger transactions and
workloads.

### Steps to set the process stack size:

<Callout type="info">

If you are using Docker you can set the process stack size when you run the
Docker container. Just add `--ulimit stack=8277716992:8277716992` to your Docker
run command, e.g. `docker run --rm -it --name memgraph --ulimit
stack=8277716992:8277716992 -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 memgraph/memgraph`

</Callout>

<Steps>

{<h3>Open `/etc/security/limits.conf` in a text editor</h3>}
You need root privileges to edit this file. This file is used to set user or
group-specific soft and hard limits for various system resources.

{<h3>Set the stack size limit</h3>}
Add the following lines to set both the soft and hard stack size limits for the
user:

```
memgraph soft stack 8087482
memgraph hard stack 8087482
```

The values `8087482` represent the stack size in kilobytes, equivalent to 8GB.

{<h3>Apply the changes</h3>}
Save your changes and exit the text editor. For the changes to take effect, the
user may need to log out and then log back in.

### Verify the changes
To check the new stack size limits, switch to the user account and run:

```
ulimit -s
```

This command should return `8087482`, confirming that the new stack size limits
have been applied.
