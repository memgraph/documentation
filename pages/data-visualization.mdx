# Data visualization in Memgraph Lab

**Memgraph Lab** is a lightweight and intuitive **visual user interface** that
enables you to:

- visualize graph data using [the Orb library](https://github.com/memgraph/orb)
- write and execute Cypher queries
- import and export data
- manage stream connections
- view and optimize query performance
- develop query modules in Python

It was designed to help you with every stage of your learning process and graph
development.

## Quick start

If you would like to query a running Memgraph database instance using **Memgraph
Lab**, be sure to:

<Steps>

### Install Memgraph Platform or Memgraph Lab

We recommend you [install **Memgraph
Platform**](/getting-started/install-memgraph) and get the complete streaming
graph application platform that includes **Memgraph database**, command-line
tool **mgconsole**, visual user interface **Memgraph Lab** running at
`http://localhost:3000` and **MAGE** - graph algorithms and modules library.

Youu can [install Memgraph Lab as a desktop
application](/data-visualization/install-and-connect#install-memgraph-lab-desktop-application)
on Windows, macOS or Linux, and if you have a public Memgraph database instance,
the web application is available at https://lab.memgraph.com/. 

### Connect to Memgraph

Connect Memgraph Lab to Memgraph and query the data using [Cypher
queries](/querying), enhanced with [advanced algorithms](/advanced-algorithms)
from the MAGE graph algorithms library.

### Check out Graph Style Script

To give your graphs a bit more pizzazz, dive into the [Graph Style Script
language](/data-visualization/graph-style-script) and learn how to customize the visual
appearance of your graphs to make them truly remarkable.
