# Storage access

The storage (or storage layer) refers to all data associated with the graph itself.
This means vertices, edges, their properties, label and other data.

Queries that are reading or writing to the graph are said to be accessing the storage.
These accesses are mediated through the `storage accessors`.
The accessors guarantee a transactional view and concurrency safety.

## Storage accessors

There are 3 types of accessors:
- **Shared access**: Allows multiple queries to run in parallel, marked as either read or write.
- **Read-only access**: Permits multiple read queries to run in parallel but forbids any write operations or queries requiring unique access.
- **Unique access**: Grants exclusive access to a single query, preventing any other type of access during its execution.

**Shared access** is the most common access granted. Any data oriented Cypher query will use it.

**Read-only access** is currently used only by `CREATE SNAPSHOT` when in ANALYTICAL mode. Using the read-only access guarantees that the snapshot is consistent, while also allowing for other (shared access) read queries to run in parallel.

**Unique access** queries is used by queries that require full control over the storage layer. These are:
- Index queries
- Constraint queries
- TTL setup queries
- Enum setup queries
- `DROP GRAPH` query
- `RECOVER SNAPSHOT` query

### Deducing the accessor type needed

The type is deduced at parsing time automatically.
Read-only and unique accesses are given based on the query type (as described in the previous section).
The shared access needs to additionally mark a query as read or write. This is also done automatically at parse-time.

The only instance where the user needs to explicitly specify the desired shared access type is when creating a managed (explicit) transactions.
These transactions acquire and hold the storage accessor at the start of their execution.
By default a write shared access is taken, but this can limit which queries can run in parallel. For the best performance, it is recommended to mark transactions with the desired access type.
For more details, refer to [Transactions](/fundamentals/transactions).

## Queries that do not require storage access

Queries that do not read or modify any graph data do not need storage access.
These queries are:
- Auth queries
- Multi-tenant queries
- Replication queries
- Show config queries
- Setting queries
- Version queries
- Transaction queue queries

Please note that even if these queries do not access the storage, they still might be accessing a shared resource and could block or throw if called in parallel.
