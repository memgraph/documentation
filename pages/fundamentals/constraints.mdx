# Constraints

In modern database systems, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy is
paramount. Constraints play a pivotal role, ensuring that only valid data is
entered into the database upon commit. The following chapters delve deep into two
fundamental types of constraints, existence and uniquness.

The existence constraint ensures the presence of specific data within the
database, while the uniqueness constraint ensures that specific label-property
pairs remain unique across entries.

## Existence constraint

Existence constraint enforces that each node with a specific label also must
have a certain property. Only one label and property can be supplied at a time.

This constraint can be enforced using the following language construct:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:label) ASSERT EXISTS (n.property);
```

To confirm that the constraint was successfully created use the following query:

```cypher
SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO;
```

Trying to modify the database in a way that violates the constraint will
yield an error.

Constraints are dropped using the `DROP` clause:

```cypher
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (n:label) ASSERT EXISTS (n.property);
```

### Example

If the database is used to hold basic employee information, each
employee should have a first name and a last name. You can enforce this by
running the following queries:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT EXISTS (n.first_name);
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT EXISTS (n.last_name);
```

The `SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO;` should return the following result:

```
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| constraint type | label           | properties      |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| exists          | Employee        | first_name      |
| exists          | Employee        | last_name       |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
```

To drop the created constraints use the following queries:

```cypher
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT EXISTS (n.first_name);
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT EXISTS (n.last_name);
```

Now, `SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO;` returns an empty set.

## Uniqueness constraint

Uniqueness constraint enforces that each label-property pair is unique. You can
also specify multiple properties when creating uniqueness constraints. 

<Callout type="info">

Adding a uniqueness constraint does not create a [label-property
index](/fundamentals/indexes), it needs to be added manually. 

</Callout>

The uniqueness constraint can be enforced using the following language
construct:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:label) ASSERT n.property1, n.property2, ..., IS UNIQUE;
```

To confirm that the constraint was successfully created use the following query:

```cypher
SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO;
```

Trying to modify the database in a way that violates the constraint will yield
an error `Unable to commit due to unique constraint violation on
:Label(property)`.

Constraints are dropped using the `DROP` clause:

```cypher
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (n:label) ASSERT n.property IS UNIQUE;
```

### Example

If the database is used to hold basic employee information, each employee should
have a unique id and email. You can enforce this by running the following query:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT n.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT n.email IS UNIQUE;
```

The `SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO;` should return the following result:

```
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| constraint type | label           | properties      |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| unique          | Employee        | id              |
| unique          | Employee        | email           |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
```

To specify multiple properties when creating uniqueness
constraints, list them one after the other:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT n.name, n.address IS UNIQUE;
```

At this point, `SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO;` yields the following result:

```
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| constraint type | label           | properties      |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| unique          | Employee        | id              |
| unique          | Employee        | email           |
| unique          | Employee        | name, address   |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
```

This means that two employees could have the same name **or** the same address,
but they can not have the same name **and** the same address. 

To drop the created constraints use the following queries:

```cypher
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT n.id IS UNIQUE;
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT n.email IS UNIQUE;
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (n:Employee) ASSERT n.name, n.address IS UNIQUE;
```

Now, `SHOW CONSTRAINT INFO;` returns an empty set.

## Schema-related procedures

You can also modify the constraints using the [`schema.assert()` procedure](/querying/schema#assert).

## Recovery

Existence and unique [constraints](/fundamentals/constraints), and indexes can be
recovered in parallel. To enable this behaviour, set the
[`storage-parallel-schema-recovery`
configuration](/configuration/configuration-settings#storage) flag to `true`.
