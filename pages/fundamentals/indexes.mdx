# Indexes

When running queries, you want to get results as soon as possible. In the
worst-case scenario, during query execution all nodes need to be checked to find
a match.

This is how [the query plan](/querying/performance-optimization) looks when there is
no index on the data:

```console copy=false
memgraph> EXPLAIN MATCH (n:Person {prop: 1}) RETURN n;
+---------------------------------+
| QUERY PLAN                      |
+---------------------------------+
| " * Produce {n}"                |
| " * Filter"                     |
| " * ScanAllByLabel (n :Person)" |
| " * Once"                       |
+---------------------------------+
```

Notice the `ScanAllByLabel` operations. By creating indexes, query execution
can be much faster because indexes partition data with a key. When a query is
executed, the engine first checks if there is an index, and instead of
explicitly checking every node, it can just check the indexed ones, making
retrieving indexed data more efficient. 

The following query creates an index on a property of a certain label:

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(prop);
```

[The query plan](/querying/performance-optimization) of a query matching that
specific node and property:

```nocopy
memgraph> EXPLAIN MATCH (n:Person {prop: 1}) RETURN n;
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| QUERY PLAN                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| " * Produce {n}"                                    |
| " * ScanAllByLabelPropertyValue (n :Person {prop})" |
| " * Once"                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

The `ScanAllByLabel` operations has been replaced by
`ScanAllByLabelPropertyValue`, a more efficient operation.

But there are also some downsides to indexing:

- each index requires extra storage (memory)
- indexes slow down write operations to the database.

It is important to choose the right data to create indexes on, as indexing all
of the content will not improve the database speed. 

The structures in the index are dynamically updated on modifications or
insertionsÂ of new nodes, slowing down the write operations.

Indexing won't bring any improvements on properties that are mostly of the same
value, as they have no proper distinguishers.

For the same reason, indexing certain data types will not bring any significant performance
gain. For example, for properties with boolean values, the time will be cut in half.

## Create an index

Indexes are not created automatically. 

You can explicitly create indexes on a data with a specific label or
label-property combination using the `CREATE INDEX ON` syntax.

### Label index

To optimize queries that fetch nodes by label, you need to create a label index:

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Person;
```

Creating an index will optimize the following type of queries:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Person) RETURN n;
```

### Label-property index

To optimize queries that fetch nodes with a certain label and property
combination, you need to create a label-property index. For the best
performance, create index on properties containing unique integer values.

<Callout type="warning">

Creating a label-property index will not create a label index!

</Callout>

For example, to index nodes that are labeled as `:Person` and have a property
named `age`:

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(age);
```

Creating an index will optimize the queries that need to match a specific label
and property combination:

```cypher
MATCH (n :Person {age: 42}) RETURN n;
```

Index will also optimize queries that filter labels and properties with the
`WHERE` clause:

```cypher
MATCH (n) WHERE n:Person AND n.age = 42 RETURN n;
```

Be aware that since the filter inside `WHERE` can contain any kind of an
expression, the expression can so complicated that the index doesn't get used.
If there is any suspicion that an index isn't used, we recommend writing
labels and properties inside the `MATCH` pattern.

#### Analyze graph

When multiple label-property indices exist, the database can sometimes select a
non-optimal index due to the data's distribution. 

The [`ANALYZE GRAPH;`](/querying/performance-optimization#analyze-graph) query
calculates the distribution of property values so the database can select a more
optimal label-property index with the smallest average property value size. The
query is run only once after all indexes have been created and data inserted in
the database.

### Speed comparison

Below is a comparison of the same query run without an index and with an index.
The query without an index took 0.015 seconds to execute, and the query with an
index 0.006 seconds.

```nocopy
memgraph> SHOW INDEX INFO;
Empty set (0.001 sec)

memgraph> MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.name =~ ".*an$" RETURN n.name;
+-------------+
| n.name      |
+-------------+
| "Lillian"   |
| "Logan"     |
| "Susan"     |
| "Sebastian" |
+-------------+
4 rows in set (0.021 sec)

memgraph> CREATE INDEX ON :Person(name);
Empty set (0.015 sec)

memgraph> MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.name =~ ".*an$" RETURN n.name;
+-------------+
| n.name      |
+-------------+
| "Lillian"   |
| "Logan"     |
| "Susan"     |
| "Sebastian" |
+-------------+
4 rows in set (0.006 sec)
```

## Show created indexes

To check all the labels and label-property pairs that Memgraph currently
indexes, use the following query: 

```cypher
SHOW INDEX INFO;
```

The query displays a table of all label and label-property indices presently
kept by Memgraph, ordered by index type, label, and property.

## Delete an index

Created indexes can be deleted using the following syntax:

```cypher
DROP INDEX ON :Label;
```

```cypher
DROP INDEX ON :Label(property);
```

These queries instruct all active transactions to abort as soon as possible.
Once all transactions have finished, the index will be deleted.

## Underlying implementation

The central part of Memgraph's index data structure is a highly-concurrent [skip
list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list). Skip lists are probabilistic
data structures that allow fast search within an ordered sequence of elements.
The structure itself is built in layers where the bottom layer is an ordinary
linked list that preserves the order. Each higher level can be imagined as a
highway for layers below.

The implementation details behind skip list operations are well documented in
the literature and are out of scope for this document. Nevertheless, we believe
that it is important for more advanced users to understand the following
implications of this data structure (`n` denotes the current number of elements
in a skip list):

- The average insertion time is `O(log(n))`
- The average deletion time is `O(log(n))`
- The average search time is `O(log(n))`
- The average memory consumption is `O(n)`

When it comes to label-property indexes, Memgraph stores a list of specific
properties that are used in label-property indexes. This list is ordered to make
the search faster. All property types can be ordered. First, they are ordered
based on the type and then within that type.
