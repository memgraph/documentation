# High availability errors

## Errors 

1. [At least one SYNC replica has not confirmed...](#error-1)

### Troubleshooting SYNC replica not being confirmed [#error-1]

If you're connecting to the cluster and encounter the error message **"At least one
SYNC replica has not confirmed..."** when writing to the main instance, several
issues could be causing this. Below are the possible reasons and how to resolve
them:

1. Network isn't correctly configured between MAIN and REPLICAs -> Check if
   hostnames/IPs can be reached.
2. Storage on replica isn't clean -> If you used your replica instances before
connecting them in the cluster, MAIN won't be able to successfully register
replica instance. Delete data directory of data instances and try to reconnect
the cluster again.
