## What port is Memgraph running on? [#error-1]

The default port Memgraph uses is `7687` is not otherwise specified.

## How to change the port?

You can change the default port using the configuration settings.

  <Tab>
  The Memgraph configuration is available in Docker's named volume `mg_etc`. On
  Linux systems, it should be in
  `/var/lib/docker/volumes/mg_etc/_data/memgraph.conf`. Keep in mind that this
  way of specifying configuration options is only valid if Memgraph was started
  [using volumes](/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker). When using Docker,
  you can also specify the configuration options in the `docker run` command:

  ```
  docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph --log-level=TRACE
  ```  
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  The Memgraph configuration is available in `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf`. If the configuration file is altered, Memgraph needs to be restarted.

To learn about all the configuration options, check out the [reference
guide](/configuration/configuration-settings).

## What is the valid range for choosing a port? [#error-2]

A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535. Ports
0 through 1023 are defined as well-known ports. Registered ports are from 1024
to 49151. The remainder of the ports from 49152 to 65535 can be used dynamically
by applications.
