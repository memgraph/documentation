## Running out of available RAM [#error-1]

This is a warning that can be disabled in the Memgraph configuration. The
Memgraph configuration is available in `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf` and you can
disable the warning with the `--memory-warning-threshold` flag. The default
value is `true`. If the configuration file is altered, Memgraph needs to be
restarted. To learn about all the configuration options, check out the
[reference guide](/database-management/configuration).
