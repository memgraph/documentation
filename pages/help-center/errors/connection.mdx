# Connection errors


## Errors

1. [Connection failure: couldn't connect to host: Connection refused.](#error-1)
2. [Error: Couldn't connect to [::]:7687 (resolved to ('[::]:7687',)):
Failed to read any data from server ResolvedIPv6Address(('::', 7687, 0, 0)).](#error-2)

### Connection refused

Check if the host and port you provided is the correct one. Also, if you have
authentication set up, make sure you provide the correct credentials when
connecting to the database. Be aware of the network settings and environment
where Memgraph and client are running (especially in Docker). The potential root
cause can be if your system has IPv6 enabled. In that case, you need to [disable
it or configure
Memgraph](/database-management/system-configuration#ipv6-networking-configuration).
