## Errors

1. [Couldn't ensure that exactly {} snapshots exist because an error occurred:
   {}. For more information about snapshots, visit: memgr.ph/snapshots.](#error-1)
2. [Couldn't ensure that only the absolutely necessary WAL files exist because an
   error occurred: {}. For more details, visit: memgr.ph/snapshots.](#error-1)

## What are snapshots? [#error-1]

Database snapshots are like a view of a database as it was at a certain point in
time. It is a read-only copy of the data that can be used for backup or data
persistence. Memgraph will try to load the newest snapshot file on startup.

## What to do with corrupt snapshots?

Because snapshots are read-only, any modifications will result in corrupt
files that won't be loaded. The solution is to delete the snapshot files and to
start Memgraph again.

## Why is data lost when Memgraph is restarted?

When you stop a Docker container, the data and state within that container are
preserved until the container is explicitly removed. This means that any data or
changes you've made within the container are retained and can be accessed again
when the container is restarted. 

To access this data, you need to ensure you're starting the same container
instance that you used previously. Here's how you can do that:

### Starting a Named Container

If you had named your Memgraph container as "memgraph", for instance, you can
easily restart it using the following command:

```
docker start memgraph
```

This command will bring the named container back to life, retaining all the data
and changes you had made in it.

### Starting an Unnamed Container

If you didn't assign a specific name to your container when you created it,
Docker would have given it a random name. To find and restart the correct
container list all the containers on your system using the following command:

```
docker ps -a
```

From the list, identify the container you want to restart. Note down the
container ID associated with it and use it to restart the container:

```
docker start [CONTAINER_ID]
```

Replace `[CONTAINER_ID]` with the actual ID you noted down. Once executed, your
container will be up and running again, with all its data intact.
