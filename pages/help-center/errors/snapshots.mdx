## Errors

1. [Couldn't ensure that exactly {} snapshots exist because an error occurred:
   {}. For more information about snapshots, visit: memgr.ph/snapshots.](#error-1)
2. [Couldn't ensure that only the absolutely necessary WAL files exist because an
   error occurred: {}. For more details, visit: memgr.ph/snapshots.](#error-1)

## What are snapshots? [#error-1]

Database snapshots are like a view of a database as it was at a certain point in
time. It is a read-only copy of the data that can be used for backup or data
persistence. Memgraph will try to load the newest snapshot file on startup.

## What to do with corrupt snapshots?

Because snapshots are read-only, any modifications will result in corrupt
files that won't be loaded. The solution is to delete the snapshot files and to
start Memgraph again.

## Why is data lost when Memgraph is restarted?

    Docker containers don’t persist data by default (all changes are lost when the
  container is stopped). You need to use local volumes to store the data
  permanently which is why Memgraph is started with the `-v` flags:

  ```console
  docker run -p 7687:7687 -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph memgraph/memgraph
  ```

  More information on Docker Volumes can be found
  [here](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).

  Make sure that Memgraph is searching for the snapshot files in the right
  directory. The Memgraph configuration is available in
  `/etc/memgraph/memgraph.conf` and you can specify the directory with the
  `--data-directory` flag. If the configuration file is altered, Memgraph needs to
  be restarted. The default directory is `/var/lib/memgraph`. To learn about all
  the configuration options, check out the [reference
  guide](/configuration/configuration-settings).
