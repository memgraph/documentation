# Auth module errors

## Errors

1. ["Couldn't authenticate user '{}' because the role '{}' doesn't exist."](#error-1)
2. ["Couldn't authenticate user '{}' because the password is not correct."](#error-1)
3. ["Operation not permitted when using an authentication module."](#error-2)
4. ["Using auth module, no role '{}' found."](#error-1)
5. [Couldn't authenticate user '{}' because the user doesn't exist. For more
   details, visit: memgr.ph/auth.](#error-2)
6. [Couldn't authenticate user '{}'. For more details, visit:
   memgr.ph/auth.](#error-1)
7. ["No user nor role '{}' found."](#error-1)


## Couldn't authenticate user [#error-1]

A user authentication can fail for many reasons. The user could be missing, 
the wrong password might be entered, the role defined by the auth module might
be missing.

## Operation not permitted when using auth module [#error-4]

Queries that modify a user's authentication data are forbidden while using 
an auth module. Users are handled by the module and local users are disabled.

## User doesn't have AUTH privilege

This error occurs when a user attempts to execute authentication or authorization queries (such as `CREATE USER`, `CREATE ROLE`, `GRANT`, `DENY`, `REVOKE`, etc.) without the required `AUTH` privilege.

### Solution

Grant the `AUTH` privilege to the user or their role:

```cypher
-- Grant AUTH privilege to a user
GRANT AUTH TO username;

-- Grant AUTH privilege to a role
GRANT AUTH TO role_name;
```

### Multi-tenant environments

In multi-tenant environments, users must also have access to the default "memgraph" database to execute authentication and authorization queries. See the [authentication requirements documentation](/database-management/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control#authentication-and-authorization-requirements) for more details.

## User doesn't have access to the memgraph database [#error-4]

This error occurs in multi-tenant environments when a user attempts to execute authentication or authorization queries but doesn't have access to the default "memgraph" database.

### Solution

Grant access to the "memgraph" database to the user or their role:

```cypher
-- Grant access to memgraph database for a user
GRANT DATABASE memgraph TO username;

-- Grant access to memgraph database for a role
GRANT DATABASE memgraph TO role_name;
```

### Best practice

In multi-tenant environments, we recommend treating the "memgraph" database as an administrative/system database and restricting access to privileged users only. See the [multi-tenancy documentation](/database-management/multi-tenancy#default-database-best-practices) for recommended setup patterns.
