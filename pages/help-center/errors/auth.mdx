## Couldn't authenticate user [#error-1]

A user authentication can fail for many reasons. The user could be missing, 
the wrong password might be entered, the role defined by the auth module might
be missing.

## Operation not permitted when using auth module [#error-4]

Queries that modify a user's authentication data are forbidden while using 
an auth module. Users are handled by the module and local users are disabled.
