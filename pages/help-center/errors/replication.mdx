## Errors

1. [Failed to connect to replica {} at the endpoint {}. For more details, visit:
   memgr.ph/replication.](#error-1)
2. [Couldn't replicate data to {}. For more details, visit:
   memgr.ph/replication.](#error-1)
3. [Write query forbidden on the replica!](#error-2)
4. [Query forbidden on the replica!](#error-2)
5. [Replication clause not allowed in multicommand transactions.](#error-3)
6. [Replication Exception: At least one SYNC replica has not confirmed committing last transaction. Check the status of the replicas using 'SHOW REPLICAS' query.](#error-4)


## Warning

1. [Snapshots are disabled for replicas. For more details, visit: memgr.ph/replication.](#warning-1)
2. [Multi-tenant replication is currently not supported!](#warning-2)

## Troubleshooting replication errors [#error-1]

1. Make sure that the Memgraph instances serving as replicas are up and running.
2. Check the firewall on your machine because it could be blocking the traffic
   requested by Memgraph.
3. Verify that there are no network problems.

## Query disabled on replica [#error-2]

Not all queries are supported on the replica. 
Any query that changes data or system setup is prohibited on the replica.
MAIN is the only source of truth.

## Query not allowed on multicommand transaction [#error-3]

System queries cannot be executed inside an multicommand/explicit transaction.

## At least one of the SYNC replicas has not confirmed committing [#error-4]

This is a spurious error. While it is true that a SYNC replica has failed to
commit, it does not mean MAIN has not committed. 
NOTE: Future release will move this error under a notification instead.

## Snapshots are disabled for replicas [#warning-1]

Because of consistency constraints, snapshots are disabled on replicas. If you
need a snapshot of the database, then create one on the main instance.

## Multi-tenant replication is not supported [#warning-2]

Memgraph supports multi-tenancy, however multi-tenant replication is at the
moment experimental. See [Experimental Replication](/configuration/experimental_replication) for more info.
