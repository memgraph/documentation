## Unable to commit due to serialization error [#error-1]

Serialization errors usually occur when there are concurrent data imports and
transactions try to work on the same data points at the same time. A common
situation that causes a serialization error is when two nodes in a graph are
being updated by two different transactions attempting to add edges between them
at the same moment. If both transactions try to add an edge at the same time, it
can cause a serialization error.

To address these problems, you can implement the following strategies:

- **Retry the transaction:** Some clients have built-in logic to automatically
  retry transactions that fail due to serialization errors.
- **Avoid conflicts:** Implement application-level logic to prevent concurrent
  transactions from modifying the same data points. This can help reduce the
  likelihood of encountering serialization errors.
