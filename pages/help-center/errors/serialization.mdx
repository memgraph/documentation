## Unable to commit due to serialization error [#error-1]

Serialization errors usually occur when there are concurrent data imports and
transactions try to work on the same data points at the same time. This
situation can occur in both testing and production environments. It's important
your code anticipates and handles these errors. A common scenario that triggers
a serialization error is when two nodes in a graph are being updated by two
different transactions attempting to add edges between them at the same moment.
If both transactions try to add an edge at the same time, it can lead to a
serialization error. While some client drivers may handle serialization errors
by retrying transactions, developers should not solely rely on this mechanism.
Always include comprehensive error handling in your application to address cases
where the error persists beyond the retry logic. For more detailed guidance on
client-specific implementations, please refer to the respective client/driver
documentation.

To address these problems, consider the following strategies:

- **Retry the transaction:** Some clients, e.g. Go client, have built-in logic
  to automatically retry transactions that fail due to serialization errors.
  There's typically a timeout associated with these retries, after which the
  client will forward the error to the application code. It is important for
  developers to be aware of this and implement additional error handling as
  needed.
- **Avoid conflicts:** Implement application-level logic to prevent concurrent
  transactions from modifying the same data points. This strategy can
  significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering serialization errors.

Handling serialization errors effectively is essential for maintaining a smooth
user experience and ensuring the reliability of your application. Implementing
robust error handling and conflict avoidance mechanisms can mitigate the impact
of these errors.
