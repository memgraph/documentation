# Expressions

The following sections describe some of the other supported features.

## String operators

Apart from comparison and concatenation operators Cypher provides special
string operators for easier matching of substrings:

| Operator          | Description                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `a STARTS WITH b` | Returns true if the prefix of string a is equal to string b.     |
| `a ENDS WITH b`   | Returns true if the suffix of string a is equal to string b.     |
| `a CONTAINS b`    | Returns true if some substring of string a is equal to string b. |

For example, if you want to return the names of all `Person` nodes where the name starts with `Joh` the query would be:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH 'Joh'
RETURN p.name;
```

## Parameters

When automating the queries for Memgraph, it comes in handy to change only some
parts of the query. Usually, these parts are values that are used for filtering
results or similar, while the rest of the query remains the same.

Parameters allow reusing the same query but with different parameter values. The
syntax uses the `$` symbol to designate a parameter name. We don't allow old
Cypher parameter syntax using curly braces. For example, you can parameterize
filtering a node property:

```cypher
MATCH (node1 {property: $propertyValue}) RETURN node1;
```

If you want to update a property of a node, you can use the following:

```cypher
MATCH (n) SET n.propertyValue = $propertyNewValue;
```

You can use parameters instead of any literal in the query. For example, if you want to filter nodes based on a specific label, you can execute the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (n:$label)
RETURN n;
```

Using parameters as property maps is partially supported, it isn't supported in `MATCH` nor `MERGE`
clause. For example, the following query is illegal:

```cypher
MATCH (n $propertyMap) RETURN n;
```

but this is supported:

```cypher
CREATE (n $propertyMap) RETURN n;
```

Memgraph also supports parameters in LIMIT clauses. For example:
```cypher
MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT $limit;
```

Additionally, Memgraph supports parameters for LOAD CSV queries. For instance:

```cypher
LOAD CSV FROM $file AS row CREATE (:Node {property: row.property});
```

To use parameters with a Python driver, use the following syntax:

```python
session.run('CREATE (alice:Person {name: $name, age: $ageValue})',
            name='Alice', ageValue=22).consume()
```

To do the same with labels:

```python
session.run('CREATE (alice:$label {name: $name, age: $ageValue}',
            label='Person', name='Alice', ageValue=22)).consume()
```

To use a property map as a parameter, you can use the following syntax:

```python
session.run('CREATE (alice:Person $propertyMap)', propertymap={"name": "Alice"}).consume()
```

To use parameters whose names are integers, you will need to wrap parameters in
a dictionary and convert them to strings before running a query:

```python
session.run('CREATE (alice:Person {name: $0, age: $1})',
            {'0': "Alice", '1': 22}).consume()
```

To use parameters with some other driver, please consult the appropriate
documentation.

## CASE

Conditional expressions can be expressed in the Cypher language with the `CASE`
expression. A simple form is used to compare an expression against multiple
predicates. For the first matched predicate result of the expression provided
after the `THEN` keyword is returned. If no expression is matched value
following `ELSE` is returned is provided, or `null` if `ELSE` is not used:

```cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN CASE n.currency WHEN "DOLLAR" THEN "$" WHEN "EURO" THEN "€" ELSE "UNKNOWN" END;
```

In generic form, you don't need to provide an expression whose value is compared
to predicates, but you can list multiple predicates and the first one that
evaluates to true is matched:

```cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN CASE WHEN n.height < 30 THEN "short" WHEN n.height > 300 THEN "tall" END;
```

Most expressions that take `null` as input will produce `null`. This includes boolean expressions that are used as
predicates. In this case, anything that is not true is interpreted as being false. This also concludes that logically `null!=null`.

The [`exists()`](/querying/functions#pattern-functions) function cannot be used with the CASE clause.

## Pattern comprehension

Pattern comprehension is a syntactic construct available in Cypher for creating a list based on matchings of a pattern.
A pattern comprehension matches the specified pattern like a normal MATCH clause, with predicates like a normal WHERE clause,
but yields a custom projection as specified.

Currently, pattern comprehensions are supported in `RETURN` and `WITH` clauses.

For example, if you want to get persons names along with the release years and titles of all the movies with 'Matrix' in their title that they
are related to the query would be:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Person)
RETURN n.name,
    [(n)-->(b:Movie) WHERE b.title CONTAINS 'Matrix' | b.released] AS years,
    [(n)-->(c:Movie) WHERE c.title CONTAINS 'Matrix' | c.title] AS titles;
```

For example, the following query finds person names with more than 5 characters, treats them as 'actors', and extracts the titles and release years
of the movies they're linked to (provided those movies were released after the year 2000), then returns all this information as lists,
alongside the corresponding actor's name.

```cypher
MATCH (n:Person) WHERE size(n.name) > 5
WITH
    n AS actor,
    [(n)-->(m) WHERE m.released > 2000 | m.title] AS titles,
    [(n)-->(m) WHERE m.released > 2000 | m.released] AS years
RETURN actor.name, years, titles;
```

The whole predicate, including the `WHERE` keyword, is optional and may be omitted.

### Storing lists as properties
It is possible to store homogenous lists of simple values as properties.
For example, the following query creates a list from the title properties of the Movie nodes connected to Keanu Reeves.
It then sets that list as a resume property on Keanu Reeves.

```cypher
MATCH (keanu:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves'})
WITH keanu,[(keanu)-->(b:Movie) | b.title] AS movieTitles
SET keanu.resume = movieTitles
RETURN keanu.resume
```

It is not, however, possible to store heterogeneous lists as properties.
For example, the following query, which tries to set a list including both the title and the released properties as the resume property
of Keanu Reeves will fail.
This is because the title property values are stored as STRING values, while the released property values are stored as INTEGER values.

```cypher
MATCH (keanu:Person {name: 'Keanu Reeves'})
WITH keanu,[(keanu)-->(b:Movie) | b.title]  + [(keanu)-->(b:Movie) | b.released] AS movieTitles
SET keanu.resume = movieTitles
RETURN keanu.resume
```
