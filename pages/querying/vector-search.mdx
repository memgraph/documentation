# Vector search

The vector search is currently an [experimental
feature](/database-management/experimental-features). 

## Run Memgraph with vector search feature 

To try out vector search feature you need to **enable** it and **configure** it.
To enable the feature set the `--experimental-enabled` to `vector-search`. To
configure the feature set the `--experimental-config` flag. 

<Callout type="info">
Changing the configuration settings depends on the way you are using Memgraph,
so please refer to the [configuration
docs](/database-management/configuration#changing-configuration) for more
information.
</Callout>

Here is the example configuration:

```shell
--experimental-config=
'
{
  "vector-search": {
    "index_name": {
      "label": "Node",
      "property": "vector",
      "dimension": 2,
      "capacity": 1000,
      "metric": "cos",
      "resize_coefficient": 2,
    }
  }
}
'
```

Keep in mind that `--experimental-enabled` and `--experimental-config` flags are
both required and the following fields are mandatory for the configuration:
`label`, `property`, `dimension` and `capacity`.

## Similarity metrics

The following table lists the supported similarity metrics for vector search. These
metrics determine how similarities between vectors are calculated. Default type
for the metric is `l2sq`.

| Metric      | Description                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip`        | Inner product (dot product).                         |
| `cos`       | Cosine similarity.                                   |
| `l2sq`      | Squared Euclidean distance.                          |
| `pearson`   | Pearson correlation coefficient.                     |
| `haversine` | Haversine distance (suitable for geographic data).   |
| `divergence`| A divergence-based metric.                           |
| `hamming`   | Hamming distance.                                    |
| `tanimoto`  | Tanimoto coefficient.                                |
| `sorensen`  | SÃ¸rensen-Dice coefficient.                           |
| `jaccard`   | Jaccard index.                                       |

## Scalar type

Properties are stored as 64-bit values in the property store and as 32-bit values in the vector index.
Scalar type define the data type of each vector element. Default type for the
metric is `f32`.
