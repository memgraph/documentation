# Vector search

The vector search is currently an experimental feature. For the exact status
please visit the [experimental
page](/database-management/experimental-features). To enable the feature use
the following `--experimental-enabled=vector-search`. To configure the feature
use `--experimental-config`. For example:
```shell
--experimental-config=
'
{
  "vector-search": {
    "index_name": {
      "label": "Node",
      "property": "vector",
      "dimension": 2,
      "capacity": 1000,
      "metric": "cos",
      "resize_coefficient": 2,
    }
  }
}
'
```
Keep in mind that both flags are required and the configuration requires the
following mandatory fields: `label`, `property`, `dimension` and `capacity`.

### Metric Kinds

The following table lists the supported metric kinds for vector search. These
metrics determine how distances between vectors are calculated. Default type
for the metric is `l2sq`.

| Metric      | Description                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip`        | Inner product (dot product).                         |
| `cos`       | Cosine similarity.                                   |
| `l2sq`      | Squared Euclidean distance.                          |
| `pearson`   | Pearson correlation coefficient.                     |
| `haversine` | Haversine distance (suitable for geographic data).   |
| `divergence`| A divergence-based metric.                           |
| `hamming`   | Hamming distance.                                    |
| `tanimoto`  | Tanimoto coefficient.                                |
| `sorensen`  | SÃ¸rensen-Dice coefficient.                           |
| `jaccard`   | Jaccard index.                                       |

### Scalar Kinds

Scalar kinds define the data type of each vector element. Default type for the
metric is `f32`.
