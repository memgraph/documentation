# Vector search

TODO(gitbuda): Explain why and what?

## Create vector indices

Vector indices are created with the `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` command. You need to give
a name to the new index and specify which label and property it should apply to.

```cypher
CREATE VECTOR INDEX vectorIndexName ON :Label(property) OPTIONS { config };
```

If you attempt to create an index with an existing name, the statement will fail.

## TODO(gitbuda): What is indexed and how?

## Show vector indices

To list all vector indices in Memgraph, use the `SHOW INDEX INFO`
[statement](/fundamentals/indexes#show-created-indexes).

## TODO(gitbuda): Query vector indices

```
CALL vector_search.query_nodes('vectorIndexName', 10, [1.0, 2.0, ...])
YIELD node, score
RETURN node, score;
```

## TODO(gitbuda): Import hints

## Drop vector indices

Vector indices are dropped with the `DROP VECTOR INDEX` command. You need to give
the name of the index to be deleted.

This statement drops the vector index named `vectorIndexName`:

```cypher
DROP VECTOR INDEX vectorIndexName;
```

If one attempts to delete an index with the same name twice, the statement will
fail.

## Compatibility

Vector search supports usage modalities that are available in Memgraph. Refer
to the table below for an overview:

| Feature                 | Support   |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| Multitenancy            | todo      |
| Durability              | todo      |
| Storage modes           | todo      |
| Replication             | todo      |
| Concurrent transactions | todo      |
