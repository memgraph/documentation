# Vector search

The vector search is currently an experimental feature. For the exact status
please visit the [experimental
page](/database-management/experimental-features). To enable the feature use
the following `--experimental-enabled=vector-search`. To configure the feature
use `--experimental-config`. For example:
```shell
--experimental-config=
'
{
  "vector-search": {
    "index_name": {
      "label": "Node",
      "property": "vector",
      "dimension": 2,
      "capacity": 1000,
      "metric": "cos",
      "scalar": "f32",
      "resize_coefficient": 2,
    }
  }
}
'
```
Keep in mind that both flags are required and the configuration requires the
following mandatory fields: `label`, `property`, `dimension` and `capacity`.

### Metric Kinds

The following table lists the supported metric kinds for vector search. These
metrics determine how distances between vectors are calculated. Default type
for the metric is `l2sq`.

| Metric      | Description                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip`        | Inner product (dot product).                         |
| `cos`       | Cosine similarity.                                   |
| `l2sq`      | Squared Euclidean distance.                          |
| `pearson`   | Pearson correlation coefficient.                     |
| `haversine` | Haversine distance (suitable for geographic data).   |
| `divergence`| A divergence-based metric.                           |
| `hamming`   | Hamming distance.                                    |
| `tanimoto`  | Tanimoto coefficient.                                |
| `sorensen`  | SÃ¸rensen-Dice coefficient.                           |
| `jaccard`   | Jaccard index.                                       |

### Scalar Kinds

Scalar kinds define the data type of each vector element. Default type for the
metric is `f32`.

| Scalar    | Description                                            |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `b1x8`    | Binary format (1 bit per element, stored in 8-bit chunks). |
| `u40`     | Unsigned 40-bit integer.                               |
| `uuid`    | Universally unique identifier (UUID).                  |
| `bf16`    | 16-bit floating point (bfloat16).                      |
| `f64`     | 64-bit floating point (double).                        |
| `f32`     | 32-bit floating point (float).                         |
| `f16`     | 16-bit floating point.                                 |
| `f8`      | 8-bit floating point.                                  |
| `u64`     | 64-bit unsigned integer.                               |
| `u32`     | 32-bit unsigned integer.                               |
| `u16`     | 16-bit unsigned integer.                               |
| `u8`      | 8-bit unsigned integer.                                |
| `i64`     | 64-bit signed integer.                                 |
| `i32`     | 32-bit signed integer.                                 |
| `i16`     | 16-bit signed integer.                                 |
| `i8`      | 8-bit signed integer.                                  |
