## Fast deep-path traversals
In contrast to other graph databases, Memgraph deep-path traversals efficiently 
handle complex graph queries, as these algorithms have been built into Memgraph's 
core. This eliminates the need for the overhead of business logic on the 
application side.

### Available built-in algorithms
There are four built-in deep path traversal algorithms: Depth-first search (DFS), 
Breadth-first search (BFS), Weighted Shortest Path and All Shortest Paths.
Below are provided basic examples and usages of these algorithms. For more 
detailed explanation, visit the 
[documentation](/advanced-algorithms/built-in-graph-algorithms). 

#### Depth-first search 
The DFS algorithm starts at the root node and explores each neighboring node as 
far as possible. The moment it reaches a dead-end, it backtracks until it finds 
a new, undiscovered node, then traverses from that node to find more undiscovered 
nodes. In that way, the algorithm visits each node in the graph.

The following query will show all the paths from node `n` to node `m`:

```cypher
MATCH path=(n {id: 0})-[*]->(m {id: 8})
RETURN path;
```

**When to use DFS?** <br/>
DFS returns all of the found paths between given nodes and is the most suitable 
for determining **path existance** between two nodes in a graph. If the output of
the algorithm is null, there are no available paths between the nodes. If the output
is not null, the DFS algorithm is going to provide all possible paths as a result.


#### Breadth-first search
In BFS, traversal starts from a single node, and the order of visited nodes is 
decided based on nodes' breadth (distance from the source node). This means that 
when a certain node is visited, it can be safely assumed that all nodes that are 
fewer relationships away from the source node have already been visited, resulting 
in the shortest path from the source node to the newly visited node.

The following query will show the shortest path between nodes `n` and `m`:

```cypher
MATCH path=(n {id: 0})-[*BFS]->(m {id: 8})
RETURN path;
```

**When to use BFS?** <br/>
BFS is ideal for finding the **shortest path** between two nodes in an unweighted 
graph or between the start node and any other node in the graph. Since it traverses 
all nodes at a given depth before moving to the next level, it ensures that the 
shortest path is found.


#### Weighted shortest path
In graph theory, the weighted shortest path problem is the problem of finding a 
path between two nodes in a graph such that the sum of the weights of relationships 
connecting nodes, or the sum of the weight of some node property on the path, is 
minimized.

To find the weighted shortest path between nodes based on the value of the 
`total_USD` node property, traversing only across `CLOSE_TO` relationships and 
return the result as a graph, use the following query:

```cypher
MATCH path=(n {id: 0})-[:CLOSE_TO *WSHORTEST (r, n | n.total_USD)]-(m {id: 15})
RETURN path;
```

**When to use WSP?** <br/>
Use the weighted shortest path algorithm when you need to find the **shortest path** 
between two nodes in a graph with **weighted** edges. This is particularly useful 
in scenarios where the cost or distance between nodes varies, such as road networks 
(where edges represent distances or travel times) or communication networks 
(where edges represent latency or cost).

When the goal is to **optimize** a specific metric along the path (e.g., minimizing 
cost, maximizing profit), a weighted shortest path algorithm can help find the path 
that optimizes that metric.


#### All shortest paths
Finding all shortest paths is an expansion of the weighted shortest paths problem. 
The goal of finding the shortest path is obtaining any minimum sum of weights on 
the path from one node to the other. However, there could be multiple 
similar-weighted paths, and this algorithm fetches them all.

The following query searches for all shortest paths with a default weight equal to 1:

```cypher
MATCH path=(n {id: 0})-[:CloseTo *ALLSHORTEST (r, n | 1)]-(m {id: 15})
RETURN path;
```

**When to use ASP?** <br/>
Use the all shortest paths algorithm when you need to find all shortest paths between 
nodes in a graph with weighted edges. This is useful when you need to analyze the 
network structure or when there may be multiple identical shortest paths between 
pairs of nodes with minimum cost.

### Optimizing graph traversals
Deep path traversal algorithms play a crucial role in exploring and analyzing 
graph data. In Memgraph, a powerful graph database management system, optimizing 
these algorithms can significantly enhance performance when dealing with 
large-scale graph structures. 

Let's dive into some strategies for optimizing traversal algorithms in Memgraph, 
along with providing examples using Cypher queries.

For example, let's take the following unoptimized query that traverses through the 
European transportation network. Using the BFS algorithm, we'll find all of the cities 
London is connected to with the shortest road path available. In other words, we'll 
find all shortest paths from the starting node with the `name` property being `London` 
to all of the nodes in the dataset. 

```cypher
MATCH path=(:City {name: 'London'})-[*BFS]->(:City)
RETURN path;
```

This query returns nodes representing cities London is connected to with the 
transportation network. 

When running a query and filtering by certain property, **avoid** using subsequent 
filtering using the `WHERE` clause and rather filter in-line.

For example, the query above could be written in the similar, but inefficient, manner:

```cypher
MATCH path=(n)-[*BFS]->(m)
WHERE n:City AND n.name = 'London' AND m:City 
RETURN path;
```

By not using the inline filtering, the database first scans all nodes and then additionally
applies filter using the `WHERE` clause, causing longer scanning time and slower 
performance.

Even though the first example is more optimized, since we didn't provide any restrictions 
and filtering, 
the algorithm might take long to traverse through graph which can lead to slower 
performance on a larger scale datasets.
 

#### Filtering by relationship type

Unlike other graph databases, Memgraph supports inline filtering, enabling efficient 
traversal through graph structures. This approach allows for precise control over 
how relationships are traversed, including filtering by type and the direction
of relationship, avoiding subsequent filtering using the `WHERE` clause.

Let's take the same example from above, but this time limiting traversal across 
roads only, eliminating other types of transportation. In other words, we'll provide
relationship type filter to the previously used query and limit it only to traverse
through the relationship type `ROAD`.

```cypher
MATCH path=(:City {name: 'London'})-[r:ROAD *BFS]->(:City)
RETURN path;
```

This way, Memgraph eliminates traversing through unnecessary relationships, shortening
the execution time. 


#### Filtering by property value 
Traversal algorithms allow an expression filter that determines if an expansion 
is allowed over a certain relationship or node property value. 

Let's take the same example from above, but this time limiting traversal through 
the European roads only. We want to apply filter to the relationship property
`continent` and set the value to exactly `Europe`. 

```cypher
MATCH path=(:City {name: 'London'})-[r:ROAD *BFS (r, n | r.continent = 'Europe')]->(:City)
RETURN path;

```

This way, Memgraph eliminates traversing through unnecessary relationships and 
property values, shortening the execution time even more. 


#### Creating indexes
Creating indexes on relevant properties can drastically speed up traversal queries 
by shortening the database scanning time. In Memgraph, indexes can be created 
using Cypher queries like:

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Node(property)
```

This query creates an index on the property of nodes, enabling faster lookups 
during algorithm traversals.

#### Constraining path length
By constraining the length of the path, the algorithm won't do unnecessary scanning
and return results after finding results with the maximum number of hops.

The following query will only return the results if the path is equal to or shorter
than 2 hops:

```cypher
MATCH path=(:City {name: 'London'})-[r:ROAD *BFS ..2 (r, n | r.continent = 'Europe')]->(:City)
RETURN path;
```

By knowing the schema of your dataset and filtering and limiting the wanted results, 
you can achieve much more optimized way of using the traversal algorithms.

## Most common pitfalls
Examples from Mrma's video

### Cartesian product queries consuming too much memory
left branch is cached ->
a lot of rows produced from left branch of Cartesian can cause memory overhead

switch branches; if that doesn't help turn off cartesian
