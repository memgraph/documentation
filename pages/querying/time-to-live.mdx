# Time to live

Time-to-live allows a user to tag vertices with an expiration time. Once a vertex has expired, the vertex and all associated edges will be deleted.

<Callout type="info">

Time-to-live is implemented as a background job that periodically gets executed. 
This is a best effort solution; meaning that even if a vertex expires, that does not mean it gets deleted right away, but eventually, once the background job gets executed.

</Callout>

## Usage

In order to use the feature the user needs to:
1. [Configure TTL](#configuration)
2. [Tag vertices with an expiration time](#tagging-vertices)

Once that is done, a background job will periodically delete expired vertices and associated edges.

### What is indexed

Time-to-live uses a label `TTL` and property `ttl` to tag vertices. A label+property value index is used to speed up query execution.

### Executed query

Time-to-live is implemented as a background job that execute the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (n:TTL) WHERE n.ttl < $now WITH n LIMIT $batch DETACH DELETE n;
```

The query DETACH DELETEs all vertices that have expired at this point in time.
The query is batched to limit the serialization errors and lost work that the error might cause.

<Callout type="warning">

Since time-to-live is implemented as a query like any other, the user might get serialization errors.
This can happen if the user is modifying an expired vertex.
The chance of serialization errors can be minimized by limiting the duration of write transactions.
In addition, the user can disable TTL before starting an important write transaction and re-enable it after commit. See [configuration](#configuration).

</Callout>

## Configuration

Time to live is by default disabled. To enable it, run:

```cypher
ENABLE TTL [EVERY "period"] [AT "time"];
```

 * period: a string literal defining the period of execution. Format: "NdNhNmNs"
 * time: a specific time at which the ttl job gets executed. Format: "24:59:59"

**NOTE:** If period is omitted while time is not, the default period value will be 1 day

The time-to-live job can be stopped and re-enabled via:

```cypher
STOP TTL;
ENABLE TTL;
```

**NOTE:** Once stopped, ttl can be re-enabled with the old configuration or a new one.

To stop and drop any index created, run:

```cypher
DISABLE TTL;
```

**NOTE:** Once disabled, ttl has to be re-enabled with a new configuration.

## Tagging vertices

In order to tag a vertex for expiration, the user needs to add the `TTL` label and `ttl` property.
`ttl` property defines when the vertex has expired as a number of microseconds since POSIX epoch. 
The user can simply input the number or can use builtin Memgraph functions to easily define the expiration time.

Arbitrary time since epoch:
```cypher
MATCH (n) SET n:TTL, n.ttl=123;
```

Set vertex to expire now:
```cypher
MATCH (n) SET n:TTL, n.ttl=timestamp();
```

Set vertex to expire 11 hours and 25 minutes from now:
```cypher
MATCH (n) SET n:TTL, n.ttl=timestamp() + timestamp(duration({hour:11, minute:25}));
```

Set vertex to expire on July 15th 2024 at 14:15:
```cypher
MATCH (n) SET n:TTL, n.ttl=timestamp(LocalDateTime("2024-07-15T14:15:00"));
```

## Authorization

Time-to-live configuration queries require permissions:
1. CONFIG
1. INDEX
1. MATCH
1. DELETE

## Compatibility

List of features and their supported status:

| Feature                     | Support   |
|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Multitenancy                | yes       |
| Durability                  | yes       |
| Storage modes               | yes (all) |
| Replication                 | yes       |
| Concurrent transactions     | yes       |
| Fine-grained access control | no        |

### Multitenancy

Time-to-live configuration is tenant based; meaning that the feature will need to be enabled and configured manually for each tenant.

### Replication 

Time-to-live background job will be execute only on MAIN and the changes will be replicated.
While the TTL effect is replicated, the configuration is not. TTL needs to be configured manually on every instance that can become MAIN.
If an instance is a REPLICA, the TTL background job will be paused util the instance becomes MAIN.
