# DROP GRAPH

In the [analytical
mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#in-memory-analytical-storage-mode), the
fastest way to delete everything in your current database is by issuing the
following query:

```cypher
DROP GRAPH;
```

The query allows the user to delete all the data, along with all the indices,
constraints, triggers, and streams, in a very efficient manner. For this query
to succeed, the user must ensure that Memgraph is operating in the
`IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL` storage mode. The user must also ensure that `DROP GRAPH`
is the only transaction running at the time of issuing the command. If any other
Cypher query is running when `DROP GRAPH` starts to execute, it will prevent
this command from running until all the other queries are finished.
