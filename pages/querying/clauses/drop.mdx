# DROP

The `DROP` commands in Memgraph provide a way to remove different types of
schema elements and data from your database. Depending on your needs, you can
choose to remove only specific structures such as indexes or constraints, or
perform a complete reset of the entire database.


Memgraph supports several `DROP` operations:

- `DROP ALL INDEXES` – removes every index in the database.
- `DROP ALL CONSTRAINTS` – removes all defined constraints.
- `DROP GRAPH` – clears the entire database, including data, indexes, constraints,
triggers, and streams, in one operation (analytical mode only).

Each of these operations serves a different purpose, ranging from cleaning up
schema elements to performing a complete reset. The following sections describe
each command in detail.

## DROP ALL INDEXES

The `DROP ALL INDEXES` clause allows you to delete all indices in your database
in a single operation. This includes all types of indices: label indices,
label-property indices, edge type indices, edge type-property indices, global
edge indices, point indices, text indices, vector indices, and vector edge
indices.

Removing all indexes can be useful if you want to redefine indexing strategies
or if you are about to load data in bulk and recreate indexes afterward.

**Syntax:**

```cypher
DROP ALL INDEXES;
```

## DROP ALL CONSTRAINTS

The `DROP ALL CONSTRAINTS` clause allows you to delete all constraints in your
database in a single operation. This includes all types of constraints:
- existence constraints
- unique constraints
- type constraints

This operation is particularly helpful when you want to redefine your schema
rules or prepare the database for significant restructuring.

**Syntax:**

```cypher
DROP ALL CONSTRAINTS;
```

## DROP GRAPH

While dropping indexes and constraints clears only schema definitions, the `DROP
GRAPH` command provides a much more comprehensive reset.

In the [analytical
mode](/fundamentals/storage-memory-usage#in-memory-analytical-storage-mode), the
fastest way to delete everything in your current database is by issuing the
following query:

```cypher
DROP GRAPH;
```

The query allows the user to delete **all data**, along with **all indices**,
**constraints**, **triggers**, and **streams**, in a very efficient manner. 

To ensure successful execution:
- Memgraph must be operating in the `IN_MEMORY_ANALYTICAL` storage mode.
- `DROP GRAPH` must be the only transaction running at the time of execution. If
any other Cypher queries are running, they must finish before this command can
proceed.

This command is ideal when you need a fresh start without manually removing data
or schema elements.
