description: A clause used for index hinting, to instruct query planned which index to use.

# USING INDEX clause

When executing a query, Memgraph query planner needs to decide where in the query it should
start matching. To get the optimal match, it checks the `MATCH` clause conditions
and finds the index that's likely to be the best choice, if there are multiple indexes
to choose from.

However, the selected index might not always be the best one. Sometimes, there
are multiple candidate indexes, and the query planner picks the suboptimal one
from a performance point of view.

With **index hinting**, you can instruct the planner to use specific index(es)
(if possible) in the query that follows. Here is the syntax for such query:

```cypher
USING INDEX :Label, :Label2 ...;
```

```cypher
USING INDEX :Label(property) ...;
```

It is also possible to specify multiple hints separated with comma. In that
case, the planner will apply the first hint that is applicable for a given
match.

An example of selecting an index with `USING INDEX`: 
```
USING INDEX :Person(name)
MATCH (n:Person {name: 'John', gender: 'male'})
RETURN n;
```

<Callout type="warning"> 

Overriding planner behavior with index hints should be used with caution, and
only by experienced developers and/or database administrators, as poor index
choice may cause queries to perform poorly.
